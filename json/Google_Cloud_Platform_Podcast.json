Responsible architects, Michael points out, continually evaluate their resources and patch, update, or remove as necessary to ensure proper security and optimize spending. Sharon helps us understand resource management further and how Active Assist helps teams find resources that can be changed or even removed for better spending, tighter security, and smaller carbon footprint.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Active Assist will even recommend the removal of entire projects that have become dormant. Michael talks in detail about Uber’s use of Active Assist and how it helped them find vulnerable projects that could be removed for better security. Sharon highlights the effects of Active Assist on reducing CO2 emissions as well, as discontinued projects keep hardware running needlessly. As Michael and his team at Uber began taking advantage of all Active Assist had to offer, Google worked with him to answer questions, tailor resources, and take feedback to improve offerings. The future includes a portfolio expansion of resource life cycle management tools to identify more idol systems like GKE clusters and helping larger customers take advantage of Active Assist at scale automatically.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together, Sharon and Michael tell us stories about the partnership and interesting findings and results of Uber’s carbon footprint

Standardization has been a human issue for a long time, from trains to international travel and more, Archana reminds us, and this challenge is now moving to the management of cloud data out in the world.

We’re talking about all the exciting announcements, how the conference has changed in recent years, and what to expect in the days ahead.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The excitement and energy of the first in-person Next since 2019 was one of the best parts for Forrest. With 1300 releases in just half the year, a lot has happened in BigQuery, AI, Looker, and more. Next includes announcements in many of these areas as well, as Google Cloud expands and makes Cloud easier for all types of projects and clients. Strategic partnerships and development have allowed better use of Google Cloud for the virtual work world and advancements in sustainability have helped Google users feel better about their impact on the environment.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New announcements in compute include C3 VMs, the first VM in the cloud with 4th Gen Intel Xeon scalable processors with Google’s custom Intel IPU. MediaCDN uses the YouTube infrastructure and the new Live Stream API optimizes streaming capabilities. Among many other announcements, Network Analyzer is now GA allowing for simplified network configuration monitoring and Google Cloud Armor has been extended to include ML-based Adaptive Protection capabilities. Software Delivery Shield and Cloud Workstations are recent offerings to help developers in each of the four areas of software supply chain management. Advancements in Cloud Build include added security benefits, and new GKE and Cloud Run logging and security alerts ensure projects remain secure through the final stages of development.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to ensure secure, optimized work is with well-trained developers. And in that vein, Google Cloud is introducing Innovators Plus to provide a new suite of developer benefits under a fixed cost subscription. Forrest tells us about #GoogleClout and the challenges available in the Next portal for conference-goers. Assured Workloads helps with data sovereignty in different regions, Confidential Space in Confidential Computing provides trust guarantees when companies perform joint data analysis and machine learning training, and Chronicle Security Operations are some of the exciting security announcements we saw at Next.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the show next week, we’ll go in depth on data announcements at Next, but Steph gives us a quick rundown of some of the biggest ones today. She talks briefly about announcements in AI, including Vertex AI Vision and Translation Hub. Forrest wraps up by talking about predictions for the future of tech and cloud.</span></p> <h5><strong>Forrest Brazeal</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forrest Brazeal</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a cloud educator, author, speaker, and Pwnie Award-winning songwriter.

This year, the DevOps research team strengthened their focus on security and discovered that one of the biggest predictors in security practice adoption is company culture. Open, communicative, and trustful company cultures are some of the best for accepting and implementing optimized security practices. Derek tells us how company cultures are measured and scored for this purpose and Nathen talks about team and individual burnout and its affects on culture.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low, medium, high, and elite teams are another indicator of culture, and Nathen explains how teams earn their label through four keys of software delivery performance. Each year, they let the data show these four clusters of team performance. But this year there were only three, and Derek talks more about this phenomenon and why the elite cluster seems to have disappeared. When operational performance analysis was added, the four clusters reemerged and were renamed to better suit the new analysis metrics. Nathen details these four new clusters: starting, which performs neither well nor poorly and may be just starting out; flowing, teams that are performing well across throughput, stability, and operational performance; slowing teams, which don’t have high throughput but excel in other areas; and retiring teams, which are reliable but not actively developing projects. We discuss how companies may shift from one cluster to another and how much context can affect this shift.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We talk about key findings in the 2022 DevOps report, especially in the security space. Some of the most notable include the adoption of DevOps security practices and the decreased incidence of burnout on teams who leverage security practices. Nathen and Derek elaborate on how this year’s research changed from last year and what remained the same.</span></p> <h5><strong>Nathen Harvey</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nathenharvey\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathen</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">works with teams helping them learn about and apply the findings of our research into high performing teams.

Because building ML models takes trial and error as we figure out what architecture and data management will work best, Experiments is a handy tool that helps developers try different variations. With extensive tracking capabilities and analysis tools, developers can see what is working, what’s not, and get ideas for other things to try.

Optimization is a huge theme this year, with a focus not only on cost optimization but also performance and resource use as well. Enterprise readiness and storage everywhere, Sean tells us, are the most important pillars as Google continues to improve offerings. We learn about Hyperdisk and the three customizable attributes users can control and the benefits of Filestore Enterprise for GKE for large client systems.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nishant talks about Cloud Storage and how clients are using it at scale for their huge data projects. Specifically, Google Storage has been working to help clients with large-scale data storage needs to optimize costs with Autoclass. Storage Insights is another new tool launching late this year or early next year that empowers better decision-making through increased knowledge and analytics of storage usage.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GKE storage is getting a revamp as well with Backup for GKE to help clients recover applications and data easily. Google Cloud for Backup and DR helps keep projects secure as well. This managed service is easy to use and integrate into all cloud projects and can be used with on prem projects and then backed up into the cloud. This is ideal for clients as they shift to cloud or hybrid systems. Companies like Redivis take advantage of some of these new data features, and Nishant talks more about how Autoclass and other tools have helped them save money and improve their business.</span></p> <h5><strong>Sean Derrington</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sean is the Group Product Manager for the storage team.

Storage Insights is another new tool launching late this year or early next year that empowers better decision-making through increased knowledge and analytics of storage usage.</p> <p>GKE storage is getting a revamp as well with Backup for GKE to help clients recover applications and data easily. Google Cloud for Backup and DR helps keep projects secure as well. This managed service is easy to use and integrate into all cloud projects and can be used with on prem projects and then backed up into the cloud. This is ideal for clients as they shift to cloud or hybrid systems. Companies like Redivis take advantage of some of these new data features, and Nishant talks more about how Autoclass and other tools have helped them save money and improve their business.</p> Sean Derrington <p>Sean is the Group Product Manager for the storage team. He is a long time storage industry PM veteran; he’s worked on Veritas, Symantec, Exablox (storage startup).</p> Nishant Kohli <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NishantKohliIoT\">Nishant</a> has a decade plus of Object Storage experience at Dell/EMC and Hitachi.

Starting with a problem sometimes brought to light by users, a solution is workshopped, and a team is brought together to tackle the issue. Once the product is workable, Gabe and his team step in to evaluate and pass it on to Anita for market launch. With examples like BigQuery Omni and AlloyDB, Anita and Gabe walk us through a real launch scenario, from naming the product to promotion and observing the satisfying impacts of a product solving real-world problems.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anita details the three phases of a product launch and which teams are involved. The phases are pre-launch, during launch, and post-launch. In pre-launch, things like naming and messaging are crafted, priority is assigned via tier assignment, and plans are made to interact with various promotional and other teams who may need to be involved with the launch. Launch day activities are coordinated next as various marketing avenues are leveraged for maximum visibility and development teams work together to make the technical side successful. Post-Launch involves some debriefing on the success of the marketing as well as analysis of use, press coverage, page views, revenue, sentiment among users, and enabling sales teams for success.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gabe talks about the importance of his team in the process as they test products for customer usability and QA before launch as well. He and Anita elaborate on the differences with Google launches versus other companies, including the stages involved in launch and the naming of these stages. Many launches are done at big Google Cloud events, like Google I/O, Anita points out as a unique feature of Google, which can be a gift and a curse. Challenges are addressed as our guests talk us through possible problems and the ways launch teams address them.

      "content:encoded": "<p>This week, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/maxsaltonstall\">Max Saltonstall</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> go behind the scenes at Google Cloud with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gabeweiss_\">Gabe Weiss</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/kibuanita\">Anita Kibunguchy-Grant</a> to learn how new products move from idea to market.</p> <p>To start, our guests walk us through a typical end-to-end life cycle as Google creates new and exciting products for users. Starting with a problem sometimes brought to light by users, a solution is workshopped, and a team is brought together to tackle the issue. Once the product is workable, Gabe and his team step in to evaluate and pass it on to Anita for market launch. With examples like BigQuery Omni and AlloyDB, Anita and Gabe walk us through a real launch scenario, from naming the product to promotion and observing the satisfying impacts of a product solving real-world problems.</p> <p>Anita details the three phases of a product launch and which teams are involved. The phases are pre-launch, during launch, and post-launch. In pre-launch, things like naming and messaging are crafted, priority is assigned via tier assignment, and plans are made to interact with various promotional and other teams who may need to be involved with the launch. Launch day activities are coordinated next as various marketing avenues are leveraged for maximum visibility and development teams work together to make the technical side successful. Post-Launch involves some debriefing on the success of the marketing as well as analysis of use, press coverage, page views, revenue, sentiment among users, and enabling sales teams for success.</p> <p>Gabe talks about the importance of his team in the process as they test products for customer usability and QA before launch as well. He and Anita elaborate on the differences with Google launches versus other companies, including the stages involved in launch and the naming of these stages. Many launches are done at big Google Cloud events, like Google I/O, Anita points out as a unique feature of Google, which can be a gift and a curse. Challenges are addressed as our guests talk us through possible problems and the ways launch teams address them. Anita and Gabe emphasize empathy and communication in product launching and the importance of clear, productive feedback.</p> Anita Kibunguchy-Grant <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kibuanita\">Anita Kibunguchy-Grant</a> is a Product Marketing Lead at Google with extensive experience across Data Analytics and Databases products and solutions.

Supporting seven languages, this tool allows clients to write a function without worrying about scaling, devops, and a number of other things that are handled by Cloud Functions automatically. Customer feedback led to new features, and that’s how the second evolution of Cloud Functions came about. Don’t worry, first gen users! This will continue to be available and supported.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Features in the 2nd gen fit into three categories: performance, cost, and control. Among other benefits, costs stay low or may even be reduced with some of the new features, larger instances and longer processing times mean better performance, and traffic splitting means better control over projects. Sara details an example illustrating the power of the new concurrency features, and Jaisen helps us understand when Cloud Functions is the right choice for your project and when it’s not.

Supporting seven languages, this tool allows clients to write a function without worrying about scaling, devops, and a number of other things that are handled by Cloud Functions automatically. Customer feedback led to new features, and that’s how the second evolution of Cloud Functions came about. Don’t worry, first gen users! This will continue to be available and supported.</p> <p>Features in the 2nd gen fit into three categories: performance, cost, and control. Among other benefits, costs stay low or may even be reduced with some of the new features, larger instances and longer processing times mean better performance, and traffic splitting means better control over projects. Sara details an example illustrating the power of the new concurrency features, and Jaisen helps us understand when Cloud Functions is the right choice for your project and when it’s not. Our guests walk us through getting started with Cloud Functions and using the 2nd gen additions.</p> <p>Companies like Lucille Games are using Cloud Functions, and our guests talk more about how specific users are leveraging the new features of the 2nd gen.</p> Jaisen Mathai <p>Jaisen is a product manager for Cloud Functions.

Prometheus, a popular monitoring solution for Kubernetes, lets you know that your project is up and running and in the event of a failure, Prometheus lets you know what happened. But as Kubernetes projects scale and spread across the globe, Prometheus becomes a challenge to manage, and that’s where Google Cloud’s Managed Service for Prometheus comes in. Lee describes why Prometheus is so great for Kubernetes, and Ashish talks about CNCF’s involvement helps open source tools integrate easily. With the help of Monarch, Google’s Managed Service stands above the competition, and Lee explains what Monarch is and how it works with Prometheus to benefit users.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashish talks about Home Depot’s use of Google Cloud and the Managed Service for Prometheus, and how Home Depot’s multiple data centers make data monitoring both trickier and more important. With Google Cloud, Home Depot is able to easily ensure everything is healthy and running across data centers, around the world, at an immense scale. He describes how Home Depot uses Managed Service for Prometheus in each of these data center environments from the point of view of a developer and talks about how easy Prometheus and the Managed Service are to integrate and use.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lee and Ashish wrap up the show with a look at how Home Depot and Google have worked together to create and adjust tools for increased efficiency.

Launched last year, Google Distributed Cloud Edge has benefited companies across many industries. Today, our guests are here to elaborate on how telecommunications companies specifically are leveraging this powerful tool.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because telcos deliver essential services, they tend to create detailed plans for their infrastructure in advance and stick with this setup for many years, DP tells us. Identifying the right tools for their project is vital, and Google has created and improved on many services to aid the telecommunications sector. Contact Center AI, for example, helps with customer service needs. Specifically, our guests elaborate on the modernization of telco networks through managed infrastructure offerings.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We learn more about Google Distributed Cloud Edge and the managed hardware and software stack that’s included. Container as a service for optimal network function is the first focus of Google in supporting telcos companies with Distributed Cloud and has been used for 5G rollouts. Google has been working behind the scenes to make Kubernetes more telco friendly as well, so that projects are more portable, scalable, and able to leverage Kubernetes benefits easily.

      "content:encoded": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/carterthecomic\">Carter Morgan</a> are back this week learning about Google’s Distributed Cloud Edge for telcos with guests <a href= \"https://twitter.com/gkrishna28\">Krishna Garimella</a> and DP Ayyadevara. Launched last year, Google Distributed Cloud Edge has benefited companies across many industries. Today, our guests are here to elaborate on how telecommunications companies specifically are leveraging this powerful tool.</p> <p>Because telcos deliver essential services, they tend to create detailed plans for their infrastructure in advance and stick with this setup for many years, DP tells us. Identifying the right tools for their project is vital, and Google has created and improved on many services to aid the telecommunications sector. Contact Center AI, for example, helps with customer service needs. Specifically, our guests elaborate on the modernization of telco networks through managed infrastructure offerings.</p> <p>We learn more about Google Distributed Cloud Edge and the managed hardware and software stack that’s included. Container as a service for optimal network function is the first focus of Google in supporting telcos companies with Distributed Cloud and has been used for 5G rollouts. Google has been working behind the scenes to make Kubernetes more telco friendly as well, so that projects are more portable, scalable, and able to leverage Kubernetes benefits easily. Krishna gives us some great real-life examples of telecommunications companies using GDC Edge in areas like virtual broadband networks. In order to dedicate maximum resources to customer workloads, the team chose to keep the Kubernetes control plane in the cloud while worker nodes are at the edge.

The scalability helps keep costs down and overall satisfaction up while leveraging advances in cloud. UJET and Google Cloud have worked together to bring this AI advancement, and our guests describe the partnership and evolution CCAI. CCAI has streamlined the Contact Center as a Service space, helping businesses work efficiently and while putting an emphasis on positive experiences for the end customer.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CCAI users can use the platform straight out of the box or customize it to build specific experiences with tools like Dialogflow. Amit further describes the tools available like Interactive Voice Response and for which circumstances each tool would be most useful. The journey to CCAI can be easily managed by a team who knows the business well. We learn more about the onboarding experience and the skills required to transition.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vasili talks about the past and future of Contact Center and how customer information is used not just for sales purposes but for bettering the customer service experience. Our guests share success stories from companies like FitBit and how CCAI is used to handle customer interactions through the app. Things like the call back feature save customers the time and frustration of waiting on hold and save businesses money.</span></p> <h5><strong>Amit Kumar</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amit is responsible for bringing GCP’s native CCaaS offering to market and helps enterprise customers modernize their contact centers.

Our guests are here to talk about new features in Contact Center AI.</p> <p>Amit starts the show helping us understand what Contact Center as a Service is and what makes this unified platform so useful for enterprise companies. The scalability helps keep costs down and overall satisfaction up while leveraging advances in cloud. UJET and Google Cloud have worked together to bring this AI advancement, and our guests describe the partnership and evolution CCAI. CCAI has streamlined the Contact Center as a Service space, helping businesses work efficiently and while putting an emphasis on positive experiences for the end customer.</p> <p>CCAI users can use the platform straight out of the box or customize it to build specific experiences with tools like Dialogflow. Amit further describes the tools available like Interactive Voice Response and for which circumstances each tool would be most useful. The journey to CCAI can be easily managed by a team who knows the business well. We learn more about the onboarding experience and the skills required to transition.</p> <p>Vasili talks about the past and future of Contact Center and how customer information is used not just for sales purposes but for bettering the customer service experience. Our guests share success stories from companies like FitBit and how CCAI is used to handle customer interactions through the app. Things like the call back feature save customers the time and frustration of waiting on hold and save businesses money.</p> Amit Kumar <p>Amit is responsible for bringing GCP’s native CCaaS offering to market and helps enterprise customers modernize their contact centers.

      "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the podcast this week, guest Joe Daly tells</span> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Stephanie Wong</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">,</span> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Mark “Money” Mirchandani</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">, and our listeners all about FinOps principles and how they’re helping companies take advantage of the cloud while saving their bottom lines. He describes FinOps as financial DevOps, making financial decisions in an effective and optimized way. With his experience in finance and tax accounting, Joe has developed a special knack for navigating the sometimes confusing world of cloud finance policies, and his contributions to the FinOps Foundation have been many.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, collaboration with various business departments is important for developing a plan that leverages the benefits of the cloud but keeps the company using resources wisely, Joe explains. He talks about the FinOps Foundation and their focus on creating community for knowledge sharing. By fostering collaboration among different company roles and promoting financial education, companies are better able to determine financial goals while making sure each facet of the company reaps all the benefits of cloud participation.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the FinOps cycle is the easiest way for community members to get started. The three steps, Joe tells us, are inform, optimize, and operate. The inform phase involves clarity in spending so teams understand how much money is being spent. In the optimize phase, benefits of spending are matched with expenditures to ensure resources are being used to their full potential. Finally, in the operate phase, engineers and finance managers come together to understand why solutions were chosen and understand if these tools are offering the right answers for the company.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every company is different but the sooner it’s possible to start the FinOps journey the easier it will be to maintain in the future. Joe gives us examples of how companies are using the principles for successful strategies and the challenges that some of them have faced.

      "content:encoded": "<p>On the podcast this week, guest Joe Daly tells <a href= \"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a>, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark “Money” Mirchandani</a>, and our listeners all about FinOps principles and how they’re helping companies take advantage of the cloud while saving their bottom lines. He describes FinOps as financial DevOps, making financial decisions in an effective and optimized way. With his experience in finance and tax accounting, Joe has developed a special knack for navigating the sometimes confusing world of cloud finance policies, and his contributions to the FinOps Foundation have been many.</p> <p>For starters, collaboration with various business departments is important for developing a plan that leverages the benefits of the cloud but keeps the company using resources wisely, Joe explains. He talks about the FinOps Foundation and their focus on creating community for knowledge sharing. By fostering collaboration among different company roles and promoting financial education, companies are better able to determine financial goals while making sure each facet of the company reaps all the benefits of cloud participation.</p> <p>Following the FinOps cycle is the easiest way for community members to get started. The three steps, Joe tells us, are inform, optimize, and operate. The inform phase involves clarity in spending so teams understand how much money is being spent. In the optimize phase, benefits of spending are matched with expenditures to ensure resources are being used to their full potential. Finally, in the operate phase, engineers and finance managers come together to understand why solutions were chosen and understand if these tools are offering the right answers for the company.</p> <p>Every company is different but the sooner it’s possible to start the FinOps journey the easier it will be to maintain in the future. Joe gives us examples of how companies are using the principles for successful strategies and the challenges that some of them have faced. The Foundation has monthly summits that offer perspectives from these companies as well as partner presentations. The FinOpsX conference is coming up soon as well. To wrap up, Joe offers other resources from the FinOps Foundation, including his podcast.</p> Joe Daly <p>Joe set up two FinOps teams at Fortune 100 companies.

Both are managed for the customer in GKE. The new addition of release channels allows flexibility with release updating so customers can adjust to their specific project needs. Each channel offers a different updating mix and speed, and clients choose the channel that’s right for their project. The idea for release channels isn’t a new one, Kobi explains. In fact, Google’s frequent project releases, while keeping things secure and running well, also can be customized by choosing from an assortment of channels in other Google offerings like Chrome.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our guests talk us through the process of releasing through channels and how each release marinates in the Rapid channel to be sure the version is supported and secure before being pushed to customers through other channels. We hear how release channels differ from no-channel releases, the benefits of specialized channels, and recommendations for customers as far as which channels to use with different development environments.

Guests <a href= \"https://twitter.com/boredabdel\">Abdelfettah Sghiouar</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/magnezi\">Kobi Magnezi</a> of the Google Cloud GKE team are here to explain.</p> <p>With releases every four months or so, Kobi tells us that Kubernetes requires two pieces to be managed with each release: the control plane and the nodes. Both are managed for the customer in GKE. The new addition of release channels allows flexibility with release updating so customers can adjust to their specific project needs. Each channel offers a different updating mix and speed, and clients choose the channel that’s right for their project. The idea for release channels isn’t a new one, Kobi explains. In fact, Google’s frequent project releases, while keeping things secure and running well, also can be customized by choosing from an assortment of channels in other Google offerings like Chrome.</p> <p>Our guests talk us through the process of releasing through channels and how each release marinates in the Rapid channel to be sure the version is supported and secure before being pushed to customers through other channels. We hear how release channels differ from no-channel releases, the benefits of specialized channels, and recommendations for customers as far as which channels to use with different development environments. Abdel describes real-world use cases for the Rapid, Regular, and Stable channels, the Surge Upgrade feature, and how GKE notifications with Pub/Sub helps in the updating process.

With better data, easier access, and substantially more cloud compute power, companies are awakening to the possibilities of geospatial driven projects that analyze not just text but photographic data as well. Thousands of satellites collect information about Earth every day, and companies are realizing just how much of this data is available for their own sustainability, geo-centric, and location-based projects. Geospatial, Nathan explains, can help combine layers of text and photo data based on one location for a richer, more robust view of a particular location in real time.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a geospatial partner with Google for a decade, NGIS has had experience using Earth Engine, Google Maps, and more to help Google Cloud customers use this data in meaningful ways. Because most projects involve analyzing locations as they change over time, companies need massive storage and processing power for their data. This is only made possible with the recent advances in infrastructure afforded by the cloud. With these amazing advances in technology, Denise and Nathan are seeing more and more exciting use cases. Companies are taking this data and making meaningful decisions for their future and the future of the planet. Sustainability goals like limiting deforestation in the supply chain can be made and measured. Climate change models can be created and applied. And all of this can be done quickly.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan and Denise talk about TraceMark, the sustainable sourcing solution built by NGIS and made to integrate flexibly with customer projects. Consumers are increasingly aware of their affect on the environment and are pushing for change. With TraceMark, companies are able to see the environmental impact of their supply chain partners and make changes in line with customer values. These decisions can influence the growth of the company as well, as suppliers are vetted and chosen based on sustainability and availability. We hear about the building of TraceMark and the challenges the team overcame. Denise runs through some features of the software and how users can take advantage of them. Our guests give some great tips for organizations to get started with their data-driven sustainability goals, and Nathan talks about what’s next with NGIS and TraceMark.</span></p> <h5><strong>Nathan Eaton</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Executive Director at NGIS, Nathan has worked with hundreds of clients to deliver fit for purpose, innovative solutions. Nathan leads our GIS capabilities and stakeholder management including consulting with a range of large multinational companies and federal government departments. Most recently, Nathan has led the development, build and launch of TraceMark, a SaaS sustainable sourcing solution from NGIS, Google Cloud and partners Planet and CARTO.</span></p> <h5><strong>Denise Pearl</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DPearl_Reframe\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Denise Pearl</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">leads strategic ISV efforts for Google Cloud’s Geospatial, Earth Observation and Sustainability vertical.

Our guests give us a quick run-down of Spanner database software and its fully-managed offerings.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spanner’s unique take on the relational database has sparked some myths. We start by addressing cost and the idea that Spanner is expensive. With its high availability achieved through synchronously replicating data, failures are virtually a non-issue, making the cost well worth it. Our guests describe other features that add to the value of Spanner as well. Workloads of any size are a good fit for Spanner because of its scalability and pricing based on use.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite rumors, Spanner is now very easy to start using. New additions like the PostgreSQL interface and ORM support have made the usability of Spanner much more familiar. Regional and multi-regional instances are supported, busting the myth that Spanner is only good for global workloads. Our guests offer examples of projects using local and global configurations with Spanner.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the database world, Vaibhav sees trends like the convergence of non-relational and relational databases as well as convergence in the OLTP and OLAP database semantics, and he tells us how Spanner is adapting and growing with these trends. Pritam points out that customers are paying more attention to total cost of ownership, the importance of scalable and reliable database solutions, and the peace of mind that comes with a managed database system. Spanner helps customers with these, freeing up business resources for other things.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Spanner has made many announcements about new capabilities coming soon, like PostgreSQL interface on spanner GA, Query Insights visualization tools, cross-regional backups GA, and more. We hear all about these awesome updates.</span></p> <h5><strong>Pritam Shah</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pritam is the Director of Engineering for Cloud Spanner. He has been with Google for about four and a half years. Before Spanner, he was the Engineering Lead for observability libraries at Google. That included Distributed Tracing and Metrics at Google scale. His mission was to democratize the instrumentation libraries. That is when he launched Open Census and then took on Cloud Spanner.</span></p> <h5><strong>Vaibhav Govil</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaibhav is the Product lead for Spanner. He has been in this role for the past three years, and before this he was a Product Manager in Google Cloud Storage in Google.

Compared to tools like Ingress, Gateway Controller allows engineers to implement more expressive solutions. While providing developers with portability has been an important part of Gateway Controller, it also gives developers freedom to use non-portable features in a structured, consistent environment and helps manage tenancy across different teams. Bowei and Abdel describe the difference between Ingress and Service and how these tools fit in with Gateway Controller. Abdel walks us through how a company would use the Gateway Controller for optimal tenancy management across name spaces and how this is an improvement over Ingress and Service.

Bowei and Abdel describe the difference between Ingress and Service and how these tools fit in with Gateway Controller.

With her more than 20 years of experience fostering growth and monetization in enterprise and education platforms, investing and working in the holistic lifestyle space, and earning her MBA while raising her two children, Vidya has certainly done a lot!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vidya tells us about her latest blog post stressing the importance of being an event-driven organization. In this business structure, reactions to events are planned in advance and developers consider how services are integrated for maximum efficiency. With synchronous extensions, projects retain flexibility in existing applications as they work with Cloud Functions to extend to new areas. Vidya gives our listeners examples of how this works.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The journey from engineer to Head of Product Management was an interesting one for Vidya, and she describes how she got started in computer engineering. Her passion for connecting with users later pushed her to product management. She tells us about her contributions to Chromebooks for Education as well as other milestones during her time with Google. Vidya talks about the support system she credits with helping her along the way and gives our listeners advice for finding mentors in their fields. She touches on the challenges she faced, describes what it was like for a woman in the industry when she first started, and offers encouragement to women getting started now. Balancing work, continuing her education, and raising children was tough, but Vidya says that, along with her incredible professional and personal support systems, defining priorities is vital.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vidya offers our listeners the insights she’s gained as she’s watched Google and workplace teams change and adapt over the years. Building an inclusive team, encouraging diverse perspectives, and defining a framework for settling disagreements are some of the pieces of advice she shares. Don’t be afraid to fail and be a risk-taker, Vidya says, because that promotes growth and learning. If you learn something new every day and have fun doing it, then you will be successful.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her spare time, Vidya leads a charitable foundation that partners with organizations in countries like India and Peru to further education, build orphanages and libraries, and provide medical care for women.

With her more than 20 years of experience fostering growth and monetization in enterprise and education platforms, investing and working in the holistic lifestyle space, and earning her MBA while raising her two children, Vidya has certainly done a lot!</p> <p>Vidya tells us about her latest blog post stressing the importance of being an event-driven organization. In this business structure, reactions to events are planned in advance and developers consider how services are integrated for maximum efficiency. With synchronous extensions, projects retain flexibility in existing applications as they work with Cloud Functions to extend to new areas. Vidya gives our listeners examples of how this works.</p> <p>The journey from engineer to Head of Product Management was an interesting one for Vidya, and she describes how she got started in computer engineering. Her passion for connecting with users later pushed her to product management. She tells us about her contributions to Chromebooks for Education as well as other milestones during her time with Google. Vidya talks about the support system she credits with helping her along the way and gives our listeners advice for finding mentors in their fields. She touches on the challenges she faced, describes what it was like for a woman in the industry when she first started, and offers encouragement to women getting started now. Balancing work, continuing her education, and raising children was tough, but Vidya says that, along with her incredible professional and personal support systems, defining priorities is vital.</p> <p>Vidya offers our listeners the insights she’s gained as she’s watched Google and workplace teams change and adapt over the years. Building an inclusive team, encouraging diverse perspectives, and defining a framework for settling disagreements are some of the pieces of advice she shares. Don’t be afraid to fail and be a risk-taker, Vidya says, because that promotes growth and learning. If you learn something new every day and have fun doing it, then you will be successful.</p> <p>In her spare time, Vidya leads a charitable foundation that partners with organizations in countries like India and Peru to further education, build orphanages and libraries, and provide medical care for women. She is an angel investor and runs workshops on creating a holistic lifestyle to help others lead well-rounded, fulfilling lives.</p> Vidya Nagarajan Raman <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/vidyanagarajan\">Vidya Nagarajan Raman</a> is the Head of Product Management for Serverless at Google Cloud.

Morgan McLean and Nimesh Bhagat describe database observability, which uses metrics, logs, and other tools to help users understand the health of your database.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We talk about Object Relational Mappers and the challenges with using these for debugging database performance. SQL Commenter helps database observability in two ways: it is both a library and a standard, Nimesh tells us. He describes the process for us, detailing exactly how SQL Commenter effects projects. Recently, SQL Commenter was donated to OpenTelemetry to augment the observability offerings, create an application standard, and make it easier for developers to use a variety of different tools and languages. Engineers can get end-to-end traces no matter which database technologies they use.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan tells us about Splunk and how information from SQL Commenter is taken into Splunk and used. Backend data like metrics from Cloud Monitoring and client libraries can be correlated together with SQL Commenter and brought into Splunk for full stack observability. Nimesh offers client examples to help us understand how these useful tools integrate for optimal observability. He tells us about the databases and ORMs supported by SQL Commenter.

Morgan McLean and Nimesh Bhagat describe database observability, which uses metrics, logs, and other tools to help users understand the health of your database.</p> <p>We talk about Object Relational Mappers and the challenges with using these for debugging database performance. SQL Commenter helps database observability in two ways: it is both a library and a standard, Nimesh tells us. He describes the process for us, detailing exactly how SQL Commenter effects projects. Recently, SQL Commenter was donated to OpenTelemetry to augment the observability offerings, create an application standard, and make it easier for developers to use a variety of different tools and languages. Engineers can get end-to-end traces no matter which database technologies they use.</p> <p>Morgan tells us about Splunk and how information from SQL Commenter is taken into Splunk and used. Backend data like metrics from Cloud Monitoring and client libraries can be correlated together with SQL Commenter and brought into Splunk for full stack observability. Nimesh offers client examples to help us understand how these useful tools integrate for optimal observability. He tells us about the databases and ORMs supported by SQL Commenter. Our guests and co-host Jan give tips to help our listeners get started with SQL Commenter and talk about what they’re looking forward to in the future of observability.</p> Nimesh Bhagat <p>Nimesh is a product manager at Google Cloud, he leads Database Observability.

Looker, Google’s data analytics platform, was built to provide enterprise companies with customizable analytics tools that allow anyone to get the data they need when they need it. This facilitates better business decisions.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leigha talks about how Looker and LookML keep data consistent among data analysts no matter where they pull data from or what they do with it. Data is more trustworthy, fostering a positive data-driven business. She details how LookML works, from database connection to metric creation, and tells us how easy it is for non-data engineers to work with as well.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robust data analysis based on trusted data points used to drive decision making is how Looker builds an environment of business intelligence rather than simple reporting.

He details their data storage and analytics structure, describing it as a reverse pyramid of tons of data with few engineers to manage and analyze it. To handle this, Postmates takes a stay-out-of-the-way approach by providing good data and letting the analysts do what they do best without micromanaging. Aaron talks about this data architecture, including the use of BigQuery as data lakes to keep data storage simple, and how Google collaboration tools streamline access and authorization tasks. Communication and flexibility are important, Aaron tells us, and he offers other advice for companies designing data systems. Feedback loops, dedicated training, and an open environment with no silos also help foster a productive, healthy data workplace.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matteo of Delivery Hero speaks to Bruno next. With the goal of increasing their global reach and offerings, it’s important that Delivery Hero has a smooth data system. Matteo outlines the new data structure they’ve built to ease onboarding of new companies and territories and describes different use cases for their data. From determining the number of delivery people necessary in each area to offering personalized customer recommendations, Delivery Hero uses Google offerings like Google Analytics and BigQuery to interpret collected data. Matteo details how they tailor data infrastructures for each use case and offers tips to help companies think through their data infrastructure design. Don’t work in a bubble, Matteo stresses, and focus on thorough onboarding of team members and clear communication with colleagues and customers.</span></p> <h5><strong>Bruno Aziza</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brunoaziza\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Bruno</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">is the Head of Data & Analytics at Google Cloud.

Google Cloud SDK was built and designed to take over mundane development tasks, allowing engineers to focus on specialized features and solutions. The SDK documentation and tutorials are an important part of this as well. With clear instructions, developers can easily make use of Cloud SDK.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software Development Kits have evolved so much over the years that recently, Cody, Wael, and their teams have found it necessary to redefine and rethink SDKs. The popularity of cloud projects and distributed systems, for example, means changes to kit requirements. The update is meant to reevaluate the software included in SDKs and CLIs and to more accurately represent what the products offer. Giving developers the tools they need in the place they work means giving developers code language options, providing thorough instruction, and listening to feedback. These are the goals of this redesign.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Google Cloud SDK contains downloadable parts and web publications. Our guests explain the types of software and documentation in each group and highlight the importance of documentation and supporting materials like tutorials. The Cloud Console is a great place for developers to start building solutions using the convenient point-and-click tools that are available. When these actions need to be repeated, the downloadable Command Line Interface tool can do the work. Cody talks about authentication and gcloud, including its relationship to client libraries. He walks us through the steps a typical developer might take when using Google products and how they relate to the SDK and CLI. Through examples, Wael helps us further understand client libraries and how they can interact with the CLI.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cloud SDK is a work in progress. Our guests welcome your feedback for future updates!</span></p> <h5><strong>Wael Manasra</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wael manages the gcloud CLI, the client libraries for all GCP services, and the general Cloud SDK developer experience.</span></p> <h5><strong>Cody Oss</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OSSCody\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Cody</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">works on the Go Cloud Client libraries where he strives to provide an delightful and idiomatic experience to all the Gophers on Google Cloud.</span></p> <h5><strong>Cool things of the week</strong></h5> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Google Tau VMs deliver over 40% price-performance advantage to customers</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/tau-vm-customers-share-real-world-performance-results\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blog</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Find products faster with the new All products page</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/find-products-faster-new-all-products-page\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blog</span></a></li> </ul> <h5><strong>Interview</strong></h5> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud SDK</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/sdk\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">site</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud SDK Documentation</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">docs</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Go</span> <a href= \"https://go.dev/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">site</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Google Cloud</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">site</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud Storage</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/storage\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">site</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud Storage Documentation</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">docs</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud Code</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/code\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">site</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud Run</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/run\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">site</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">GKE</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">site</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud Functions</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/functions\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">site</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud Client Libraries</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/cloud-client-libraries\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> docs</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud Shell</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/shell\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">site</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud Shell Editor</span> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/editor-overview\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">docs</span></a></li> </ul> <h5><strong>What’s something cool you’re working on?</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carter is working on his comedy.</span></p> <h5><strong>Hosts</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carter Morgan and Mark Mirchandani</span></p>",

The popularity of cloud projects and distributed systems, for example, means changes to kit requirements. The update is meant to reevaluate the software included in SDKs and CLIs and to more accurately represent what the products offer. Giving developers the tools they need in the place they work means giving developers code language options, providing thorough instruction, and listening to feedback. These are the goals of this redesign.</p> <p>The Google Cloud SDK contains downloadable parts and web publications. Our guests explain the types of software and documentation in each group and highlight the importance of documentation and supporting materials like tutorials. The Cloud Console is a great place for developers to start building solutions using the convenient point-and-click tools that are available. When these actions need to be repeated, the downloadable Command Line Interface tool can do the work. Cody talks about authentication and gcloud, including its relationship to client libraries. He walks us through the steps a typical developer might take when using Google products and how they relate to the SDK and CLI. Through examples, Wael helps us further understand client libraries and how they can interact with the CLI.</p> <p>The Cloud SDK is a work in progress. Our guests welcome your feedback for future updates!</p> Wael Manasra <p>Wael manages the gcloud CLI, the client libraries for all GCP services, and the general Cloud SDK developer experience.</p> Cody Oss <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OSSCody\">Cody</a> works on the Go Cloud Client libraries where he strives to provide an delightful and idiomatic experience to all the Gophers on Google Cloud.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Google Tau VMs deliver over 40% price-performance advantage to customers <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/tau-vm-customers-share-real-world-performance-results\"> blog</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Find products faster with the new All products page <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/find-products-faster-new-all-products-page\"> blog</a></li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud SDK <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/sdk\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud SDK Documentation <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs\">docs</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Go <a href= \"https://go.dev/\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Google Cloud <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud Storage <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/storage\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud Storage Documentation <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs\">docs</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud Code <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/code\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud Run <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/run\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">GKE <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud Functions <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/functions\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud Client Libraries <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/cloud-client-libraries\"> docs</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud Shell <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/shell\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud Shell Editor <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/editor-overview\">docs</a></li> </ul> What’s something cool you’re working on? <p>Carter is working on his comedy.</p> Hosts <p>Carter Morgan and Mark Mirchandani</p>",

Jason tells us how this evolution of Cloud Run has led to the support of bigger, more complicated, and even legacy software fully and efficiently functioning in a serverless environment. The team at Google continues to expand offerings in order to afford the benefits of auto-scaling and other managed services to all workloads. Always On CPU, for example, supports projects with running background functions.</p> <p>Later, Jason gives us examples of projects that best fit a serverless infrastructure and the cost benefits of using Cloud Run. He offers cost-saving tips for projects, like committed use discounts and auto-scaling limits. Balancing cost efficiency with global reliability is important, and Jason tells us how this is easily achieved with Cloud Run features like scaling to zero.</p> <p>To limit the barrier to entry for new Cloud Run and container users, Jason and his team have been working on open source build packs.

The easy setup steps and uncomplicated UI help customers move from their on-prem infrastructure to Google Cloud where scaling, local customer support, and other advantages can be easily leveraged while maintaining a secure, compliant environment.</p> <p>With so many compliance standards in sectors like finance and healthcare, our guests walk us through the process Assured Workloads clients go through from identifying the regulations of markets they participate in to planning their data security, keeping customer support local to maintain privacy, and using Google Cloud to put these plans into practice with their projects across the world. On the Google Cloud side, the team works to create regulation maps that organize the rules of potential markets so customers can click a button and rest easy knowing their projects are compliant. Bryce details what goes into making Google Services like GKE compliant for customers as well. Assured Workloads continues to grow as new client challenges are presented.

Together, these tools make the three pillars of geospatial cloud: analysis of vector data with tools like CloudSQL or BigQuery, analysis of image data with Earth Engine, and taking advantage of the data assets. This geospatial analysis helps us understand the world and how it’s changing, then apply this information to make important, environmentally friendly decisions.</p> <p>As a key part of this system, Earth Engine is a geospatial data-processing platform specializing in the analysis of satellite images and other image data. It provides access to over 800 datasets and processing software that scales to planetary-scale analysis. At Next, Google announced Earth Engine availability for commercial use. Our guests talk about the applications of this in the real world, from the effect of climate risk on a financial portfolio to locations most susceptible to forest fire.</p> <p>Chad and Joel tell us about the sources of Earth Engine’s data, the pre-processing work done to the images collected, and the ease of data sharing between platforms. By working with BigQuery, users have access to additional datasets and analytics tools as well. Google clients are taking this data and creatively using the information to make meaningful decisions. Insurance companies, for example, analyze data to assess flood risk, while the U.S. Forest Service uses the platform to advance their mission of sustainable forest management. Unilever uses Earth Engine in their commitment to zero additional deforestation in their supply chain, and our guests talk more about the Next presentation with Unilever. Additional BigQuery announcements at Next can be leveraged in Earth Engine as well, and new features such as Analytics Hub make accessing datasets even easier.</p> <p>Google works to meet users where they are and make tools easy to use from day one.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> is back this week with cohost Bukola Ayodele. We’re talking with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">Eric Schmidt</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brunoaziza\">Bruno Aziza</a> about all the awesome new analytics, data, and AI launches from last week’s Google Cloud Next conference.</p> <p>Our guests start the show outlining the challenges clients face when storing, organizing, and analyzing data in the cloud. These needs have inspired Google solutions that focus on simplifying data management for customers. Next announcements like BigQuery Omni, which helps customers achieve full data visibility with cross-cloud analytics, and DataPlex, which facilitates data management at scale, will change the way companies think about their data. BigQuery integration with AppSheets and the new Cloud Looker LookML let customers build once and access from anywhere. The new Looker and Tableau integration revolutionizes the use of the semantic model in Tableau, allowing things like company-established data governance and the Looker Blocks ecosystem to pull into Tableau analysis. New Looker Blocks specifically targeted to the healthcare industry were also introduced at Next.</p> <p>We talk about the ML announcements including Vertex AI Workbench, a fully-managed service used for data exploration aimed at simplifying the workloads of data engineers. Serverless Spark on Google Cloud shares these goals by making performance tuning, scaling, infrastructure provisioning, and other tasks fully-managed. The new PostgreSQL interface for Spanner lets clients use tools already developed in PostgreSQL while leveraging the global scaling and other benefits of Spanner.</p> <p>Bruno and Eric share some favorite customer stories as we wrap up this week’s episode. Albertson’s, Renault, and others have interesting data journeys on Google Cloud and our listeners can learn more in the YouTube series hosted by Bruno.</p> <h5 id=\"eric-schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</h5> <p>Eric is the the Head of Advocacy for Data Analytics at Google and has been at Google for almost eight years. Previously, he was with Microsoft, where he led Advocacy and Evangelism there, too.

      "content:encoded": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> is back this week with cohost Bukola Ayodele. We’re talking with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">Eric Schmidt</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brunoaziza\">Bruno Aziza</a> about all the awesome new analytics, data, and AI launches from last week’s Google Cloud Next conference.</p> <p>Our guests start the show outlining the challenges clients face when storing, organizing, and analyzing data in the cloud. These needs have inspired Google solutions that focus on simplifying data management for customers. Next announcements like BigQuery Omni, which helps customers achieve full data visibility with cross-cloud analytics, and DataPlex, which facilitates data management at scale, will change the way companies think about their data. BigQuery integration with AppSheets and the new Cloud Looker LookML let customers build once and access from anywhere. The new Looker and Tableau integration revolutionizes the use of the semantic model in Tableau, allowing things like company-established data governance and the Looker Blocks ecosystem to pull into Tableau analysis. New Looker Blocks specifically targeted to the healthcare industry were also introduced at Next.</p> <p>We talk about the ML announcements including Vertex AI Workbench, a fully-managed service used for data exploration aimed at simplifying the workloads of data engineers. Serverless Spark on Google Cloud shares these goals by making performance tuning, scaling, infrastructure provisioning, and other tasks fully-managed. The new PostgreSQL interface for Spanner lets clients use tools already developed in PostgreSQL while leveraging the global scaling and other benefits of Spanner.</p> <p>Bruno and Eric share some favorite customer stories as we wrap up this week’s episode. Albertson’s, Renault, and others have interesting data journeys on Google Cloud and our listeners can learn more in the YouTube series hosted by Bruno.</p> Eric Schmidt <p>Eric is the the Head of Advocacy for Data Analytics at Google and has been at Google for almost eight years. Previously, he was with Microsoft, where he led Advocacy and Evangelism there, too. He focuses on products like BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc and leads a team of advocates who help customers turn data into value.

      "description": "<p>On the podcast this week, our guests Brian Schwarz and Sean Derrington discuss the ins and outs of the new storage launches with your hosts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbrojbrojbro\">Jenny Brown</a>. Brian gives light introductions to the five facets of Google’s data storage portfolio, like the primary storage solutions for files, storage of backups of data, and data transfer software and hardware.</p> <p>Lately, the Google team has been enhancing existing data solutions and building new ones. Cloud Storage’s multi-region and custom dual-region options easily let customers keep data safe and accessible. Our guests explain what happens behind the scenes to make these features so effective. Brian and Sean describe the user experience, including how clients can see when data is being replicated and where. New capabilities like Turbo Replication allow more modernization for clients moving to the cloud as well.</p> <p>Sean talks about the new Filestore Enterprise, which allows companies to move critical apps to the cloud quickly and securely, and we learn why accurate, fast file and data replication is so important for these large customers. If there is corruption or accidental deletion of a file, Brian and Sean tell us about the fail-safes that are in place and the process for recovery. Filestore Enterprise, Filestore Basic, and GKE working together offer a more customized approach for large clients, allowing them to allocate their critical projects to Enterprise and other less important applications to Basic.

      "content:encoded": "<p>On the podcast this week, our guests Brian Schwarz and Sean Derrington discuss the ins and outs of the new storage launches with your hosts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbrojbrojbro\">Jenny Brown</a>. Brian gives light introductions to the five facets of Google’s data storage portfolio, like the primary storage solutions for files, storage of backups of data, and data transfer software and hardware.</p> <p>Lately, the Google team has been enhancing existing data solutions and building new ones. Cloud Storage’s multi-region and custom dual-region options easily let customers keep data safe and accessible. Our guests explain what happens behind the scenes to make these features so effective. Brian and Sean describe the user experience, including how clients can see when data is being replicated and where. New capabilities like Turbo Replication allow more modernization for clients moving to the cloud as well.</p> <p>Sean talks about the new Filestore Enterprise, which allows companies to move critical apps to the cloud quickly and securely, and we learn why accurate, fast file and data replication is so important for these large customers. If there is corruption or accidental deletion of a file, Brian and Sean tell us about the fail-safes that are in place and the process for recovery. Filestore Enterprise, Filestore Basic, and GKE working together offer a more customized approach for large clients, allowing them to allocate their critical projects to Enterprise and other less important applications to Basic. Stateful applications in containers are becoming more popular as well, and our guests tell us how Backup for GKE is the easiest way to protect GKE workloads.</p> Brian Schwarz <p>Brian has had 20 years in product management in data center infrastructure.

To start the show, Megan gives us a quick rundown of Kubernetes, an open-source tool to orchestrate containers and manage other GCP resources. She explains the difference between declarative and imperative to help us better understand the basics of Kubernetes.</p> <p>We tackle the challenges people face when beginning their Kubernetes journey and how it works with other open-source projects, like Anthos. This year, Megan and her team have been working to help developers understand the Kubernetes Resource Model, a concept that helps define how companies can organize and run clusters, enforce policies, and more for improved standardization across multiple teams.</p> <p>Megan explains GitOps, a deployment model for Kubernetes focusing on Git, and takes us through examples of implementation. We learn about Config Sync and how it helps with optimizing and automating GitOps. Megan goes over some other valuable tools, including Open Policy Agent and Gatekeeper, which help developers specify not just which resources are allowed, but also what kinds of things are allowed within each resource.</p> <p>We wrap up the show with a discussion on streamlining the development process with strategic use of Kubernetes and the help of open-source tools like Skaffold.

How does Kubernetes relate to cookies, Disney World, and Pokemon? Kaslin, Anthony, and Gari break it down.</p> <p>Next, each guest talks their favorite GKE features and what makes the service different. Kaslin loves the persistent storage feature, among others. Anthony appreciates the evolution of GKE to a place where it supports many different workloads and situations for clients and how easy it is to get started with GKE. GKE’s ability to connect easily to other GCP products and features and GKE Autopilot are some of Gari’s favorite things about the service.</p> <p>Best practices and advice for new users are shared by our guests. From practical tips for project planning to encouragement with long-term problem solving, our guests offer listeners resources and ideas for a successful GKE project. Kaslin, Anthony, and Gari share their favorite customer stories with us and talk about the fun, interesting events Google has hosted for GKE customers.</p> <p>The future of GKE looks bright, with new options for Windows containers, expanded Autopilot uses, and multicluster support. KubeCon is coming up soon, so keep an eye out for more Kubernetes and GKE news!</p> <h5 id=\"anthony-bushong\">Anthony Bushong</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kagmsbwho\">Anthony Bushong</a> has been working in the field with production GKE users, both large and small, for almost 5 years now.

How does Kubernetes relate to cookies, Disney World, and Pokemon? Kaslin, Anthony, and Gari break it down.</p> <p>Next, each guest talks their favorite GKE features and what makes the service different. Kaslin loves the persistent storage feature, among others. Anthony appreciates the evolution of GKE to a place where it supports many different workloads and situations for clients and how easy it is to get started with GKE. GKE’s ability to connect easily to other GCP products and features and GKE Autopilot are some of Gari’s favorite things about the service.</p> <p>Best practices and advice for new users are shared by our guests. From practical tips for project planning to encouragement with long-term problem solving, our guests offer listeners resources and ideas for a successful GKE project. Kaslin, Anthony, and Gari share their favorite customer stories with us and talk about the fun, interesting events Google has hosted for GKE customers.</p> <p>The future of GKE looks bright, with new options for Windows containers, expanded Autopilot uses, and multicluster support.

Allison, a Cloud Technical Resident, starts the show telling us about the program and how it brought her to Firestore.</p> <p>Allison takes us through the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases and describes the four categories of NoSQL databases: family, document, key value, and graph. Firestore is a scalable, flexible NoSQL document database. To illustrate the uses and benefits of Firestore, Allison walks us through a delicious pizza example. Each document in the database belongs to a collection, which is used to organize these documents. Firestore documents are assigned an identifier and can be quickly changed and called within their collections. Because these documents are stored in an implicit schema in key value pairs, developers have control over the details of database organization and data change and growth are easy to manage. The availability of subcollections further adds to the flexibility of Firestore database design.</p> <p>Choosing a database type will depend on the situation, and Allison suggests this starts with a look at CAP theorem. If a document database is your database of choice, Allison gives our listeners tips for getting started with Firestore and clearing any hurdles along the way.</p> <h5 id=\"allison-kornher\">Allison Kornher</h5> <p>Allison is a Cloud Technical Resident and has worked helping startups looking to join GCP and in the Premium Tier Cloud Support organization with a focus on Storage.</p> <h5 id=\"cool-things-of-the-week\">Cool things of the week</h5> <ul> <li>BigQuery admin reference guide: Tables & routines <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/bigquery-admin-reference-guide-tables-routines\"> blog</a></li> <li>Top 25 Google Search terms, now in BigQuery <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/top-25-google-search-terms-now-in-bigquery\"> blog</a></li> <li>Three security and scalability improvements for Cloud SQL for SQL Server <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/improving-cloud-sql-for-sql-server-security-and-scalability\"> blog</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 247: Cloud SQL Insights with Nimesh Bhagat <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-247-cloud-sql-insights-with-nimesh-bhagat/\"> podcast</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 163: Cloud SQL with Amy Krishnamohan <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-163-cloud-sql-with-amy-krishnamohan/\"> podcast</a></li> </ul> <h5 id=\"interview\">Interview</h5> <ul> <li>Cloud Firestore <a href= \"https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Firestore Documentation <a href= \"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore\">docs</a></li> <li>Cloud Firestore explained: for users who never used Firestore before <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/cloud-firestore-explained-users-who-never-used-firestore\"> blog</a></li> <li>Gabi on Twitter <a href= \"https://twitter.com/gabidavila\">site</a></li> <li>Datastore <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/datastore\">site</a></li> <li>BigTable <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable\">site</a></li> <li>Firebase Realtime Database <a href= \"https://firebase.google.com/docs/database\">site</a></li> <li>Memorystore <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/memorystore\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Spanner <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/spanner\">site</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 248: Cloud Spanner Revisited with Dilraj Kaur and Christoph Bussler <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-248-cloud-spanner-revisited-with-dilraj-kaur-and-christoph-bussler/\"> podcast</a></li> <li>All you need to know about Firestore: A cheatsheet <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/all-you-need-know-about-firestore-cheatsheet\"> blog</a></li> </ul> <h5 id=\"what-s-something-cool-you-re-working-on\">What’s something cool you’re working on?</h5> <p>Brian has been working on <a href= \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26910960/share-a-persistent-disk-between-google-compute-engine-vms\"> sharing a persistent disk between Google Compute Engine VMs</a>.</p> <ul> <li>Cloud Storage <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/storage\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Filestore <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/filestore\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud SQL <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql\">site</a></li> </ul>",

Because these documents are stored in an implicit schema in key value pairs, developers have control over the details of database organization and data change and growth are easy to manage. The availability of subcollections further adds to the flexibility of Firestore database design.</p> <p>Choosing a database type will depend on the situation, and Allison suggests this starts with a look at CAP theorem. If a document database is your database of choice, Allison gives our listeners tips for getting started with Firestore and clearing any hurdles along the way.</p> Allison Kornher <p>Allison is a Cloud Technical Resident and has worked helping startups looking to join GCP and in the Premium Tier Cloud Support organization with a focus on Storage.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>BigQuery admin reference guide: Tables & routines <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/bigquery-admin-reference-guide-tables-routines\"> blog</a></li> <li>Top 25 Google Search terms, now in BigQuery <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/top-25-google-search-terms-now-in-bigquery\"> blog</a></li> <li>Three security and scalability improvements for Cloud SQL for SQL Server <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/improving-cloud-sql-for-sql-server-security-and-scalability\"> blog</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 247: Cloud SQL Insights with Nimesh Bhagat <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-247-cloud-sql-insights-with-nimesh-bhagat/\"> podcast</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 163: Cloud SQL with Amy Krishnamohan <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-163-cloud-sql-with-amy-krishnamohan/\"> podcast</a></li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li>Cloud Firestore <a href= \"https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Firestore Documentation <a href= \"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore\">docs</a></li> <li>Cloud Firestore explained: for users who never used Firestore before <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/cloud-firestore-explained-users-who-never-used-firestore\"> blog</a></li> <li>Gabi on Twitter <a href= \"https://twitter.com/gabidavila\">site</a></li> <li>Datastore <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/datastore\">site</a></li> <li>BigTable <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable\">site</a></li> <li>Firebase Realtime Database <a href= \"https://firebase.google.com/docs/database\">site</a></li> <li>Memorystore <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/memorystore\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Spanner <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/spanner\">site</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 248: Cloud Spanner Revisited with Dilraj Kaur and Christoph Bussler <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-248-cloud-spanner-revisited-with-dilraj-kaur-and-christoph-bussler/\"> podcast</a></li> <li>All you need to know about Firestore: A cheatsheet <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/all-you-need-know-about-firestore-cheatsheet\"> blog</a></li> </ul> What’s something cool you’re working on? <p>Brian has been working on <a href= \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26910960/share-a-persistent-disk-between-google-compute-engine-vms\"> sharing a persistent disk between Google Compute Engine VMs</a>.</p> <ul> <li>Cloud Storage <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/storage\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Filestore <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/filestore\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud SQL <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql\">site</a></li> </ul>",

Our guests introduce us to three new Google offerings, BigQuery Omni, Dataplex, and the Analytics Hub, and discuss the uses and implications of each and how they work together to achieve goals.</p> <p>Bruno and Eric describe challenges in data analytics and how Google uses these as opportunities to create problem-solving systems that solve real client problems. Through real-world examples from companies like Equifax, we see how companies are getting more information from their data in a way that creates actionable opportunities to improve customer experiences.</p> <p>For multi-cloud companies, BigQuery Omni gets the most out of data that exists in multiple clouds. To accomplish this, Google takes the analytics to the data and is able to reach all appropriate data across clouds without having to move it. This allows for cheaper analysis with much less system downtime. Support for Azure was added this year.</p> <p>The new Dataplex software helps customers intelligently manage data assets, especially in distributed systems. Dataplex lets companies automatically discover data, make data secure without having to move it, and apply governance and policies centrally so the data is accessible. Rather than sit unused, data can now be found easily, analyzed securely, and put to work for companies no matter where their data lives.</p> <p>For analytic asset sharing, Analytics Hub lets companies coordinate with others to get the most use out of their data efficiently. Analytics Hub gets to data value as quickly and easily as possible. Companies can publish, discover, and subscribe to shared assets, create exchanges that combine data sets, and curate exchanges of data and insights for full information sharing.</p> <h5 id=\"eric-schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">Eric</a> is the Head of Advocacy for Data Analytics at Google and has been with us for almost 8 years.

SRE is Google’s way of helping companies of all sizes create consistent, predictable, and functional projects. It helps clients approach operations from a software engineering stand point so that growing systems can be managed efficiently.</p> <p>We talk about the challenges of implementing best SRE practices and how companies can overcome these. Though the benefits of SRE are many, it can be difficult for clients to grasp. Steve and Yuri tell us the process they go through with customers to help them set realistic goals and work to make reliable, scalable projects with little downtime. By starting small and taking wins early, Steve says clients reap the rewards of SRE and are encouraged to push forward.

Apigee, an API management platform that is a part of Google Cloud, focuses on all steps of the digital product life cycle to make API management easy for clients. The software company SAP provides data storage and other business support for different types of companies across the world. Together, Apigee and SAP allow data to be collected, stored, organized, and securely accessed and shared with other applications.</p> <p>The shift to e-commerce and the desire for tailored experiences has driven the need for more API usage and therefore better API management. SAP and Apigee, with their myriad features, allow businesses to keep up with these increasing demands efficiently. We hear examples of how companies are leveraging these tools and use cases where the power of SAP and Apigee benefit customers most. Our guests describe the developer experience as well. We talk about the process of creating a project with both SAP and Apigee and why both tools working together makes the developer’s job easier. Planning your project with an “API first” mindset means choosing APIs and SAP software early in the planning process to better align your project with your business goals. Apigee can help you manage these APIs securely, letting you choose the data that is shared. The use of both SAP and Apigee helps companies to realize long-term efficiency and streamlined operations as development becomes easier with each additional API.</p> <h5 id=\"benjamin-schuler\">Benjamin Schuler</h5> <p>Benjamin Schuler is a Solution Manager for SAP at Google Cloud with a focus on topics around application modernization.

Our guests this week, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/shacharguz\">Shachar Guz</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/GabeWeiss_\">Gabe Weiss</a>, start the show explaining DMS, focusing on the ease of infrastructure management for cloud users.</p> <p>Migration is made simpler with DMS, and Shachar and Gabe walk us through the process of using this powerful new service. Our guests outline some hurdles to migration and how DMS and the DMS documentation help developers overcome them. Shacher tells us the steps companies should take before and after running DMS to ensure projects run correctly and business logic is preserved as well, and Gabe stresses the importance of testing.</p> <p>Database Migration Service focuses on open source, and we talk about why this is an important benefit. In addition, the thorough explanations embedded in DMS help users navigate easily, serverless technology means projects are fast and efficient, and native applications are leveraged for better transparency. And it’s free.</p> <h5 id=\"shachar-guz\">Shachar Guz</h5> <p>Shachar is a product manager at Google Cloud, he works on the Cloud Database Migration Service. Shachar worked in various product and engineering roles and shares a true passion about data and helping customers get the most out of their data.

Our guests this week, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/shacharguz\">Shachar Guz</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/GabeWeiss_\">Gabe Weiss</a>, start the show explaining DMS, focusing on the ease of infrastructure management for cloud users.</p> <p>Migration is made simpler with DMS, and Shachar and Gabe walk us through the process of using this powerful new service. Our guests outline some hurdles to migration and how DMS and the DMS documentation help developers overcome them. Shacher tells us the steps companies should take before and after running DMS to ensure projects run correctly and business logic is preserved as well, and Gabe stresses the importance of testing.</p> <p>Database Migration Service focuses on open source, and we talk about why this is an important benefit. In addition, the thorough explanations embedded in DMS help users navigate easily, serverless technology means projects are fast and efficient, and native applications are leveraged for better transparency. And it’s free.</p> Shachar Guz <p>Shachar is a product manager at Google Cloud, he works on the Cloud Database Migration Service.

Our guests talk about the types of projects that will benefit most from the use of Dart and how Dart is expanding to offer more features and better usability.

When designing and building machine learning projects, it’s important to plan and integrate functions that support a responsible model as well. Tracy and Craig help us understand the process of designing and building these responsible, efficient projects, from problem identification and data set collection and refinement to ethical model considerations and finally project construction.</p> <p>Part of Responsible AI is considering all the stakeholders of a project and how they will be impacted. Through examples, Tracy demonstrates how businesses can decide if the software solution affects stakeholders in a way the business would be proud of. Starting in the planning stages and continuing through data collection and model training, companies employing responsible AI techniques will consider input from groups that may use or be affected by the model, from social scientist who specialize in human behavior, and others.

      "description": "<p>This week on the show, our guests <a href= \"https://twitter.com/asrivas_dev\">Anu Srivastava</a> and Sudheera Vanguri talk about Document AI with hosts <a href= \"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/dalequark\">Dale Markowitz</a>. Document AI uses artificial intelligence to improve the way businesses create and manage things like paystubs, tax forms, contracts, and virtually any other business document. Data normally stored on paper can be parsed, enriched, and structured, then stored securely with the use of Document AI. Data becomes more accessible and more manageable.</p> <p>Our guests go on to describe the process of using this powerful tool and instances where developers and enterprise companies could benefit. We talk about Lending DocAI and Procurement DocAI and how offerings like Google Vision and Knowledge Graph enhance these powerful tools. Users of Document AI can take advantage of these tools as well as bring their own expertise to create custom models.</p> <p>Later, we learn about the developer experience when using the Document AI Platform. Our guests talk specifically about the use of Knowledge Graph and how the advanced search capabilities allow Document AI users to collect data from myriad sources, filling in missing information and enhancing the search with other useful data to make your results more usable. To demonstrate the use of the platform and integrated Google AI tools, we hear about the real-world examples of Workday and Mr. Cooper and their document processing and model training.</p> <h5 id=\"sudheera-vanguri\">Sudheera Vanguri</h5> <p>Sudheera Vanguri is the head of Product Management at Google Cloud Document AI.</p> <h5 id=\"anu-srivastava\">Anu Srivastava</h5> <p>Anu Srivastava is an Applied AI Engineer for ML on Google Cloud.

GKE Autopilot manages tasks like quantity and size of nodes so deploying workloads is faster and machines are used efficiently. Autopilot also offers cluster management options, including monitoring the health of nodes and other components.</p> <p>William and Yochay explain that GKE Autopilot was built to aid companies in the efficient use of resources and give clients more time to focus on their projects. Important efficiency features that are optional in GKE, like multidimensional pod autoscaling, are employed automatically for clients in Autopilot, giving clients peace of mind. Kubernetes best practices are auto-deployed for projects so clients can rest assured things will run as quickly and smoothly as possible without extra work.</p> <p>Kubernetes is a great way to manage containers, and our guests describe cases where this tool is best suited. We compare GKE standard mode and Autopilot, and Yochay tells us when developers might choose standard mode to allow for more specific customization. He talks about migrating between standard and Autopilot clusters with the goal of easy migration by the end of this year. Security is important for GKE, and we talk about the Autopilot security configurations and why they were chosen.</p> <p>Later, our guests walk us through the process of a Kubernetes project on Autopilot, highlighting decisions this tool makes automatically for you and why. Though Autopilot sounds very much like a serverless offering, William explains the differences between tools like Cloud Run and GKE Autopilot.

GKE Autopilot manages tasks like quantity and size of nodes so deploying workloads is faster and machines are used efficiently. Autopilot also offers cluster management options, including monitoring the health of nodes and other components.</p> <p>William and Yochay explain that GKE Autopilot was built to aid companies in the efficient use of resources and give clients more time to focus on their projects. Important efficiency features that are optional in GKE, like multidimensional pod autoscaling, are employed automatically for clients in Autopilot, giving clients peace of mind. Kubernetes best practices are auto-deployed for projects so clients can rest assured things will run as quickly and smoothly as possible without extra work.</p> <p>Kubernetes is a great way to manage containers, and our guests describe cases where this tool is best suited. We compare GKE standard mode and Autopilot, and Yochay tells us when developers might choose standard mode to allow for more specific customization. He talks about migrating between standard and Autopilot clusters with the goal of easy migration by the end of this year. Security is important for GKE, and we talk about the Autopilot security configurations and why they were chosen.</p> <p>Later, our guests walk us through the process of a Kubernetes project on Autopilot, highlighting decisions this tool makes automatically for you and why. Though Autopilot sounds very much like a serverless offering, William explains the differences between tools like Cloud Run and GKE Autopilot. We also hear about the future of Autopilot, including some exciting new features coming soon.</p> Yochay Kiriaty <p>Yochay is a Product Manager for GKE responsible for security.</p> William Denniss <p>William is a Product Manager for GKE Autopilot.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/briandorsey\">Brian Dorsey</a> joins <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> this week for an in-depth discussion on Workflows. Guests Kris Braun and Guillaume Laforge introduce us to Google Cloud Workflows, explaining that this fully managed serverless product helps connect services in the cloud. By facilitating the creation of an end-to-end schema, Workflows lets developers specify what microservices or other software respond when certain events occur in a detailed, visual format.</p> <p>Kris and Guillaume list the benefits of using Workflows and detail the many uses for this powerful tool. The ability to add detailed descriptors, for example, helps companies avoid errors in calling up other pieces of software. New employees have an easier time getting acquainted when the steps are clearly defined as well. Our guests use real-world examples to illustrate the three main uses for Workflows: event-driven, batch, and infrastructure automation. Workflows are flexible and customizable.</p> <p>Later, we hear about Cloud Composer and its relation to Workflows, and our guests help us understand which product is right for each client type. The Workflows team continues to expand offerings. More connectors are being added to allow developers to call other GCP services. Working with lists will soon be easier, allowing Workflows to run steps in parallel. And Kris details other exciting updates coming soon, including Eventarc.</p> <h5 id=\"kris-braun\">Kris Braun</h5> <p>Kris Braun is the Product Manager for three Google Cloud products that connect services to build applications: Workflows, Tasks, and Scheduler.

Guests Kris Braun and Guillaume Laforge introduce us to Google Cloud Workflows, explaining that this fully managed serverless product helps connect services in the cloud. By facilitating the creation of an end-to-end schema, Workflows lets developers specify what microservices or other software respond when certain events occur in a detailed, visual format.</p> <p>Kris and Guillaume list the benefits of using Workflows and detail the many uses for this powerful tool. The ability to add detailed descriptors, for example, helps companies avoid errors in calling up other pieces of software. New employees have an easier time getting acquainted when the steps are clearly defined as well. Our guests use real-world examples to illustrate the three main uses for Workflows: event-driven, batch, and infrastructure automation. Workflows are flexible and customizable.</p> <p>Later, we hear about Cloud Composer and its relation to Workflows, and our guests help us understand which product is right for each client type. The Workflows team continues to expand offerings. More connectors are being added to allow developers to call other GCP services. Working with lists will soon be easier, allowing Workflows to run steps in parallel. And Kris details other exciting updates coming soon, including Eventarc.</p> Kris Braun <p>Kris Braun is the Product Manager for three Google Cloud products that connect services to build applications: Workflows, Tasks, and Scheduler.

      "description": "<p>This week on the podcast, fellow Googlers <a href= \"https://twitter.com/kaslinfields\">Kaslin Fields</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/agmsbush\">Anthony Bushong</a> chat with hosts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> about how to optimize your spending with Google Kubernetes Engine.</p> <p>Cost optimization doesn’t necessarily mean lower costs, Kaslin explains. It means running your application the best possible way and accommodating things like traffic spikes while keeping costs as low as possible. As our guests tell us, standard best practices can aid in optimization, but when it comes to efficiently running on a budget, there are more tips and tricks available in GKE. One of GKE’s newest operation modes, Autopilot, means Kubernetes nodes are now managed by Google. Customers pay by the pod so the focus can be on the application rather than the details of clusters and their optimization. Best practices for resource utilization and autoscaling are included with Autopilot.</p> <p>Kaslin and Anthony break up Google’s GKE cost optimization tips into four categories: multi-tenancy, autoscaling, infrastructure choice, and workload best practices and tell us how company culture effects these decisions. Proper education around Kubernetes and GKE specifically is the first step to using resources the most efficiently, Anthony tells us. Keeping tenants separate and resources well managed on multi-tenant clusters is made easier with Namespaces. Scaling pods and the infrastructure around them is an important part of optimization as well, and Anthony helps us understand the best practices for fine tuning the autoscaling features in GKE. Scaling infrastructure to handle spikes or lulls is an automatic feature with Autopilot, helping projects run smoothly.

      "content:encoded": "<p>This week on the podcast, fellow Googlers <a href= \"https://twitter.com/kaslinfields\">Kaslin Fields</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/agmsbush\">Anthony Bushong</a> chat with hosts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> about how to optimize your spending with Google Kubernetes Engine.</p> <p>Cost optimization doesn’t necessarily mean lower costs, Kaslin explains. It means running your application the best possible way and accommodating things like traffic spikes while keeping costs as low as possible. As our guests tell us, standard best practices can aid in optimization, but when it comes to efficiently running on a budget, there are more tips and tricks available in GKE. One of GKE’s newest operation modes, Autopilot, means Kubernetes nodes are now managed by Google. Customers pay by the pod so the focus can be on the application rather than the details of clusters and their optimization. Best practices for resource utilization and autoscaling are included with Autopilot.</p> <p>Kaslin and Anthony break up Google’s GKE cost optimization tips into four categories: multi-tenancy, autoscaling, infrastructure choice, and workload best practices and tell us how company culture effects these decisions. Proper education around Kubernetes and GKE specifically is the first step to using resources the most efficiently, Anthony tells us. Keeping tenants separate and resources well managed on multi-tenant clusters is made easier with Namespaces. Scaling pods and the infrastructure around them is an important part of optimization as well, and Anthony helps us understand the best practices for fine tuning the autoscaling features in GKE. Scaling infrastructure to handle spikes or lulls is an automatic feature with Autopilot, helping projects run smoothly. To control workloads efficiency, GKE now offers a host of features, including horizontal, vertical, and multidimensional pod autoscaling.</p> <p>Later, we walk through the steps for implementing some of these optimizations decisions while keeping your application running. GKE Usage Metering is a useful tool for measuring tenant usage in a cluster so resource distribution can be managed easier.</p> Kaslin Fields <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaslinfields\">Kaslin</a> is a Developer Advocate at Google Cloud where she focuses on Google Kubernetes Engine.</p> Anthony Bushong <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/agmsbush\">Anthony</a> is a Specialist Customer Engineer at Google Cloud, where he focuses on Kubernetes.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>A2 VMs now GA—the largest GPU cloud instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/a2-vms-with-nvidia-a100-gpus-are-ga\"> blog</a></li> <li>How carbon-free is your cloud?

The changes brought on by the pandemic meant more companies had to support a distributed business, and Chrome OS has been able to facilitate this transition easily. With zero-touch enrollment, Chromebooks can be sent directly to employees, bypassing IT. Chromebooks can be configured through the Google Admin Console without any physical contact.</p> <p>Courtney tells us about her experiences with Chrome OS at Intel and how the automatic updates, computing speed, and other features have made her job easier. She explains the process of working with Google to develop Chromebook hardware and how the cloud comes into play for maximum performance. We talk about the many Chromebook options offered and what options will be available in the future.</p> Angela Gosz <p>Angela Gosz is a Customer Success Manager on the Chrome Enterprise Team, based out of Google Chicago. With 17 years of experience in the IT Industry, Angela has been on the leading edge of digital transformation implementations, supporting Enterprise organizations and partners to adopt and optimize their endpoint computing strategy - especially in Healthcare. Today she ensures customers realize the full potential of their investment in Chrome OS as a cloud-first endpoint. Outside of work, she has been meditating daily for 5 years, teaches yoga and is a certified Reiki practitioner. Angela holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Journalism from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p> Courtney Harrison <p>Courtney is an Account Director with Intel Corporation based in the San Francisco Bay area. Currently Courtney leads a team that supports all of the Intel business interactions with Alphabet and Google. A twenty-one year Intel veteran, Courtney has spent the past fifteen years in field sales working with top multi-national customers and local OEMs. Courtney began her career at Intel in CPU operations. Courtney has both a Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree from Stanford University in Industrial Engineering.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>A new podcast explores the unseen world of data centers <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/where-the-internet-lives-new-podcast/\"> blog</a></li> <li>Back by popular demand: Google Cloud products in 4 words or less (2021 edition) <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/back-popular-demand-google-cloud-products-4-words-or-less-2021-edition\"> blog</a></li> <li>Save the date for Google Cloud Next ‘21: October 12-14, 2021 <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/announcing-google-cloud-next21\"> blog</a></li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li>Intel <a href= \"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html\">site</a></li> <li>Chromebook <a href= \"https://www.google.com/chromebook/\">site</a></li> <li>Chrome OS <a href= \"https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/\">site</a></li> <li>Chromebook turns 10 <a href= \"https://www.google.com/chromebook/10th-birthday/\">site</a></li> <li>Building the future of business computing: 10 years of Chrome OS <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/10thbirthday-chromeos-enterprise\"> blog</a></li> <li>Form Factor Portfolio <a href= \"https://chromeenterprise.google/devices/\">site</a></li> <li>Deploy devices with zero-touch enrollment <a href= \"https://support.google.com/a/answer/9508498?hl=en\">site</a></li> <li>Thunderbolt <a href= \"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/io/thunderbolt/thunderbolt-technology-general.html\"> site</a></li> <li>WiFi 6 <a href= \"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/wireless/wi-fi-6-series.html?wapkw=wifi%206\"> site</a></li> <li>CloudReady <a href= \"https://www.neverware.com/freedownload#intro-text\">site</a></li> <li>MCA <a href= \"https://chromeenterprise.google/moderncomputing/\">site</a></li> </ul> What’s something cool you’re working on? <p>Mark is working on <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/costs-meet-code-programmatic-budget-notifications\"> Costs meet code with programmatic budget notifications</a>.</p> Sound Effects Attribution <ul> <li>“LeDancing” by Frankum of <a href= \"https://Freesound.org\">Freesound.org</a></li> <li>“Jingle Romantic” by Jay_You of <a href= \"https://Freesound.org\">Freesound.org</a></li> </ul>",

      "description": "<p>Jenny Brown co-hosts with <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> this week for a great conversation about the ML lifecycle with our guests Craig Wiley and Dale Markowitz. Using a real-life example of bus cameras detecting potholes, Dale and Craig walk us through the steps of designing, building, implementing, and improving on a piece of machine learning software.</p> <p>The first step, Craig tells us, is to identify the data collected and determine its viability in an ML model. He describes how to get the best data for your project and how to keep the data, code, and libraries consistent to allow better analysis by your ML models. He talks about the importance of a Feature Store to aid in data consistency. Craig explains how machine learning pipelines like TensorFlow are great tools to improve consistency in the ML environment as well, making it easier to improve your model and even to build new ones using the same data. Keeping this consistency from data scientist analyzation to ML developer to model deployment means a more efficient process and product.</p> <p>Evaluating models after production is an important step in the lifecycle as well to ensure accuracy, validity, and performance of the model. Craig gives us some examples and tips on monitoring models after they’ve been deployed. We talk about the challenges of scaling ML projects and Craig offers advice for developers and companies looking to build ML projects.</p> <h5 id=\"dale-markowitz\">Dale Markowitz</h5> <p>Dale Markowitz is an Applied AI Engineer for ML on Google Cloud.

      "description": "<p>This week on the podcast, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/gabidavila\">Gabi Ferrara</a> talk with Nimesh Bhagat about Cloud SQL Insights. This powerful tool enables developers to diagnose database issues for faster, smoother performance.</p> <p>Nimesh tells us the inspiration for Cloud SQL Insight’s development and describes its biggest benefits. One of the important aspects of Insights is the ability for developers to gain an application-centric view by allowing them to tag database queries with SQL comments. These tags are aggregated in Insights and give developers a visual of the database queries. Here, developers can see load patterns and use that information to improve database efficiency. Cloud SQL Insights offers managed database analysis that helps developers understand the past and predict the future.</p> <p>Simplifying the journey of database debugging, Nimesh explains, was the goal of creating Cloud SQL Insights. He takes us through the process of using the software, pointing out the improvements Insights makes over the old way. Cloud SQL Insights only launched in January, but it’s already helping numerous clients with their projects.

Online multiplayer gaming with its need for fast, consistent state sharing among players benefits from dedicated servers and offers cheating mitigation and reduced latency, as well as development flexibility.

      "description": "<p>Guest host Sara Ford joins our old favorite <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> this week for a special interview with <a href= \"https://twitter.com/NASA\">NASA</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/FDL_AI\">FDL</a>. Our guests, James Parr and Madhulika Guhathakurta, give us a super cool, in-depth look at how NASA and FDL do what they do. Lika explains the important scientific studies she has worked on during her years at NASA and how she came to understand and appreciate Machine Learning. James introduces us to the Frontier Development Lab, a project collaborated on by private and public companies to leverage AI and Machine Learning in the research of science, exploration, and many other disciplines.</p> <p>From saving Earth from asteroids to conducting research on our sun, James describes the process of solving these solar system sized problems, starting with creating a solid team. Machine Learning is a team sport, he says, and like making a Hollywood film, it takes many people from different backgrounds to find these solutions. The cloud has been integral in facilitating this meeting of the minds and the analyzing of data at FDL.</p> <p>Later, we talk about the process of astronomical research before the current technological age and how techniques have advanced into the 21st century. James tells us the origin story of FDL and how they were tasked with applying Machine Learning to complex problems like planetary defense and space weather. Lika describes space weather and details how it impacts our planet. We talk about the role of data engineers in the team sport of astro-research and how data is collected and analyzed. Lika emphasizes the benefits of building a working system and how the processes can be applied to many other disciplines.</p> <p>James and Lika wrap up the show with a look at what cool things they expect in the future.</p> <h5 id=\"james-parr\">James Parr</h5> <p>James is Director of the Frontier Development Lab, in partnership with NASA ARC and the SETI Institute.

      "content:encoded": "<p>Guest host Sara Ford joins our old favorite <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> this week for a special interview with <a href= \"https://twitter.com/NASA\">NASA</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/FDL_AI\">FDL</a>. Our guests, James Parr and Madhulika Guhathakurta, give us a super cool, in-depth look at how NASA and FDL do what they do. Lika explains the important scientific studies she has worked on during her years at NASA and how she came to understand and appreciate Machine Learning. James introduces us to the Frontier Development Lab, a project collaborated on by private and public companies to leverage AI and Machine Learning in the research of science, exploration, and many other disciplines.</p> <p>From saving Earth from asteroids to conducting research on our sun, James describes the process of solving these solar system sized problems, starting with creating a solid team. Machine Learning is a team sport, he says, and like making a Hollywood film, it takes many people from different backgrounds to find these solutions. The cloud has been integral in facilitating this meeting of the minds and the analyzing of data at FDL.</p> <p>Later, we talk about the process of astronomical research before the current technological age and how techniques have advanced into the 21st century. James tells us the origin story of FDL and how they were tasked with applying Machine Learning to complex problems like planetary defense and space weather. Lika describes space weather and details how it impacts our planet. We talk about the role of data engineers in the team sport of astro-research and how data is collected and analyzed. Lika emphasizes the benefits of building a working system and how the processes can be applied to many other disciplines.</p> <p>James and Lika wrap up the show with a look at what cool things they expect in the future.</p> James Parr <p>James is Director of the Frontier Development Lab, in partnership with NASA ARC and the SETI Institute.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon Foust</a> joins <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark</a> this week as we talk with Nandhini Rangan and Magda Jary about Cloud Learning Services. The Cloud Learning Services team is passionate about helping technical practitioners elevate their careers and transform businesses by building and validating in-demand Google Cloud skills. Nandhini explains that a lack of technical practitioners with skills in the cloud is one of the biggest barriers to entry for companies considering the shift. But with the right knowledge, companies that take full advantage of cloud environments are proven to be more efficient, reach more of their goals, and overall, be more successful. Cloud Learning Services offerings empower technical practitioners and companies to learn new skills, put these skills into practice, and achieve their objectives.</p> <p>Magda tells us that these training courses focus around job roles in the cloud. The cloud has necessitated a shift in the idea of development learning, she tells us, explaining that nowadays, the focus is on job roles, like Data Scientist, and the technological requirements of that job rather than learning one coding language.</p> <p>We talk later about the specific offerings Cloud Learning Services provides. With a focus on hands-on learning, technical practitioners are put into the real Google Cloud environment with Qwiklabs, while videos and lectures accompany the material. Job-specific skill badges and certifications are earned as courses are completed, allowing technical practitioners and employers to better understand what proficiency in each job role looks like. Our guests tell us more about Qwiklabs and how its sandbox environment facilitates better learning without the added cost and commitment of services that they may not be ready to use. When the time for real-world development comes, this hands-on approach means no disconnect between learning and applying. We talk more about the Challenge Labs used to test learning and the skill badges earned on completion.</p> <p>To wrap up, we discuss the future of Cloud Learning Services and how the team stays on top of new technologies and job roles to keep learning materials updated and fun. The team is working on new material for badging and certifying business professionals as well.</p> <p>Resources to check out to learn more about Google Cloud training and certifications: <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/training\">https://cloud.google.com/training</a> <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/certification\">https://cloud.google.com/certification</a></p> <p>Follow a learning path designed to help you prepare for the certification most suited to your role: <a href= \"https://g.co/cloud/getcertified\">https://g.co/cloud/getcertified</a></p> <h5 id=\"nandhini-rangan\">Nandhini Rangan</h5> <p>Nandhini Rangan works at Google Cloud Learning and is very passionate about the topic of upskilling, reskilling, and especially for cloud roles that are needed in organizations today, but also defining the roles and jobs of the future.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon Foust</a> are together again this week, speaking with NVIDIA VP of Applied Deep Learning Research <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ctnzr\">Bryan Catanzaro</a>. Bryan and his team focus on using deep learning to enhance NVIDIA’s offerings.</p> <p>Since Bryan was last a guest on the show, NVIDIA has been doing some amazing things. We talk about the A100 Tensor Core GPU and the massive effort it took to create, the new RTX graphics cards great for gaming, and the differences between them. Bryan explains how the new A100 chips compare to the previous versions, saying the new chips are larger, but with almost three times the power, making them ideal for things like precise calculations. And, as Bryan says, with better computation and more insight, we can make discoveries that benefit humanity. While the new RTX graphic cards are cheaper than previous versions, they are faster and more powerful, making gaming and video streaming much more enjoyable. Background noises and objects can even be removed with the help of deep learning.</p> <p>Jon and Bryan talk about The Black Box at NVIDIA and what demos Jon hopes to see on his next visit. With this as the catalyst, Bryan talks more about how the NVIDIA architecture and the deep learning they employ have created efficient 8k graphics rendering for truly powerful gaming experiences.

Bryan and his team focus on using deep learning to enhance NVIDIA’s offerings.</p> <p>Since Bryan was last a guest on the show, NVIDIA has been doing some amazing things. We talk about the A100 Tensor Core GPU and the massive effort it took to create, the new RTX graphics cards great for gaming, and the differences between them. Bryan explains how the new A100 chips compare to the previous versions, saying the new chips are larger, but with almost three times the power, making them ideal for things like precise calculations. And, as Bryan says, with better computation and more insight, we can make discoveries that benefit humanity. While the new RTX graphic cards are cheaper than previous versions, they are faster and more powerful, making gaming and video streaming much more enjoyable. Background noises and objects can even be removed with the help of deep learning.</p> <p>Jon and Bryan talk about The Black Box at NVIDIA and what demos Jon hopes to see on his next visit. With this as the catalyst, Bryan talks more about how the NVIDIA architecture and the deep learning they employ have created efficient 8k graphics rendering for truly powerful gaming experiences. Outside of gaming, DLSS could have farther reaching benefits as the model learns new purposes, and Bryan talks us through some fun examples.</p> <p>With the acquisitions of Mellanox and ARM, Bryan explains that NVIDIA has been able to streamline networking and really take advantage of powerful performance at all stages.

Because it is an open source offering, Kubernetes has grown and adapted quickly. Alex elaborates, pointing out that Kubernetes has helped redefine how people create cloud native applications. A year after Kubernetes was born, Google introduced Google Kubernetes Engine to help simplify things for developers while optimizing scalability and efficiency.</p> <p>Our guests talk about the progression of GKE over its short life, what’s new with the latest version, and why reliability and scalability have become the focus for year six. Later, we hear examples of companies taking advantage of everything GKE has to offer and how the symbiotic relationship between Google and its customers has helped GKE grow. In the world of gaming, GKE’s global scaling capabilities have been vital. Drew talks about Anthos, explaining that it helps businesses run Kubernetes in their controlled on-prem system while leaving the option for an easy cloud migration in the future.</p> <p>We wrap up the show with a look into the Kubernetes crystal ball where Drew sees a more adaptive Kubernetes and GKE. Alex hopes to continue to simplify GKE, making it easier and easier to use anywhere in the world.</p> <h5 id=\"alex-zakonov\">Alex Zakonov</h5> <p>Alex Zakonov leads Google Kubernetes Engine team being responsible for operations of Google K8S fleet and for driving innovation in the K8S management.

To start the show, GG introduces us to Bare Metal Solution, explaining that it allows client projects built on specialized, often outdated software to take advantage of the benefits of a cloud environment. Using Bare Metal Solution, clients can choose to migrate all or part of their projects for a fully customized experience.</p> <p>We learn how Bare Metal Solution is able to support a partial or full native solution for clients and go through the steps to getting a project from completely on-prem to the cloud where latency is decreased, security is increased, and other cloud benefits can be leveraged. GG gives examples of situations where Bare Metal is a great option for clients, for instance an established company with an early 90s database that recently branched out into apps built in cloud native software. James outlines the benefits of Bare Metal Solution over other options, including real world examples of industries that have been able to modernize their offerings and adapt with the Bare Metal.</p> <p>GG and James wrap up the show explaining why the open source aspect of Bare Metal is so important to the evolution and flexibility of the product, and we talk about the recent developments at Bare Metal.</p> <h5 id=\"james-harding\">James Harding</h5> <p>James Harding leads the Data Management Practice for North America, with responsibility for the go-to-market strategy for all products and services data mangement.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pvergadia\">Priyanka</a> is back this week, joining <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark</a> as we talk big data with our guests Prabhu Palanisamy and Jarrett Garcia. Iron Mountain, a data management company, securely stores hard-copy and online data for enterprise customers. SpringML aides enterprises in the use of data analytics and machine learning to transform their projects. With the help of SpringML and Google Cloud, Iron Mountain migrated much of their data to datalakes and cloud storage for easier access and manipulation of the data.</p> <p>Jarrett and Prabhu talk about the process of migrating so much data, including the main goals of their partnership. First, they established systems that could be repeated and help Iron Mountain understand when data is moved, destroyed, migrated, and more. We discuss the next steps taken, learning how Iron Mountain moved so much data to the cloud. Using Google products like DataFlow, BigQuery, and Cloud Composer, SpringML was able to take the data from Iron Mountain’s landing zone and transform it. Prior planning meant that the system was optimized and ready from the beginning, complete with automation and tools to make a fast, effective migration of data without any restructuring. Later, the data visualization is done by GSuite, Google Data Studio, and Looker so Iron Mountain and their customers can use the data for analysis.</p> <p>Later in the show, Jarrett describes real-life situations in which Iron Mountain has helped manage, migrate, and store data for customers. Prabhu details the lessons SpringML learned while working on this project and offers advice to other developers. He talks about the future of the project, explaining that now that the data has been migrated, more detailed analytics can be performed and machine learning projects added on to augment Iron Mountain’s offerings.</p> <h5 id=\"jarrett-garcia\">Jarrett Garcia</h5> <p>Jarrett Garcia recently joined Iron Mountain as the Director of Enterprise Data. At Iron Mountain, Jarrett is working closely with the executive leadership team to build a robust Enterprise Data Platform in the cloud. His partnership with Google Cloud is a critical component to the transformation journey. Before coming to Iron Mountain, Jarrett worked as a Lead Architect at Nielsen within their Technology R&D team to create an AI/ML platform in the cloud. Jarrett has been at the forefront in introducing modern technologies into the organization such as Docker, TensorFlow, and Kubernetes. Before that, he lead the Data Science technology team where he spent over a decade building analytic tools and ushering in new technology.</p> <h5 id=\"prabhu-palanisamy\">Prabhu Palanisamy</h5> <p>Prabhu Palanisamy is co-founder of SpringML. He has a long history of running data-driven consulting organizations from Software AG to Appirio. Building on relationships he created leading integration and analytics services, Prabhu co-founded SpringML, a next generation data analytics company that serves data intensive industries.

      "description": "<p>On the podcast this week, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/briandorsey\">Brian Dorsey</a> talk with fellow Googlers John Laham and Stewart Reichling about Traffic Director, a managed control plane for service mesh. Traffic Director solves many common networking problems developers face when breaking apart monoliths into multiple, manageable microservices. We start the conversation with some helpful definitions of terms like data plane (the plane that data passes through when one service calls on another) and service mesh (the art of helping these microservices speak with each other) and how Traffic Director and the Envoy Proxy use these concepts to streamline distributed services.</p> <p>Envoy Proxy can handle all sorts of networking solutions, from policy enforcement to routing, without adding hundreds of lines of code to each project piece. The proxy can receive a request, process it, and pass it on to the next correct piece, speeding up your distributed system processes. But Envoy can do more than the regular proxy. With its xDS APIs, services can configure proxies automatically, making the process much more efficient. In some instances, the same benefits developers see with a distributed system can be gained from distributed proxies as well. To make distributed proxy configuration easy and manageable, a managed control plane system like Traffic Director is the solution. Traffic Director not only helps you facilitate communication between microservices, it also syncs distributed states across regions, monitors your infrastructure, and more.</p> <h5 id=\"stewart-reichling\">Stewart Reichling</h5> <p>Stewart is a Product Manager on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), based out of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Building off Solr, Lucidworks created Fusion, an environment more conducive to easy AI-enhanced query capabilities, better scalability, and more. With Fusion, developers can take advantage of the highly advanced relevance tuning tools such as query rewrites, which analyze user behavior and automatically rewrite queries based on that information.</p> <p>On the tech side, Fusion was built with a combination of Java, Kubernetes to increase scalability, Solr management tools, and logging and reporting tools. The engineers at Lucidworks have created Fusion-specific system-enhancing pieces as well, including a machine learning service that allows data scientists to train their models elsewhere and plug them in for a completely customized experience. The team also created Smart Answers, which is a Q-And-A system built on a search engine that can connect to chatbots, virtual assistants, and others. Radu goes into detail explaining the Smart Answers system and how the layers of the project work together. We also learn about the customization capabilities and integration of Smart Answers.</p> <p>Radu wraps up the show with interesting use-case stories and how Fusion is working in the real world. In the future, Lucidworks will be available right in the GCP marketplace!</p> <h5 id=\"radu-miclaus\">Radu Miclaus</h5> <p>Radu has over 12 years of experience in the data science space with applications in general machine learning architecture, search, customer analytics, risk and financial analysis.

The Pandium platform helps companies build and support in-app marketplaces with a focus on software integration and flexibility.</p> <p>Kelly and Cristina start by explaining how Pandium deals with scalability for clients with multiple users and partners. Cristina elaborates on Pandium’s role in facilitating integrations, helping customers build customized, flexible solutions. We discuss how APIs are handled and the way Pandium takes care of authentication, security, and other standard pieces.</p> <p>We continue with a thorough discussion of ‘yes code’, ‘low code’, and ‘no code’ approaches, and the benefits and drawbacks of each system. With a combination approach of some ‘no code’ tools and other ‘yes code’ pieces, Pandium allows better customization in any code language, while keeping some functions easy for non-engineers.</p> <h5 id=\"cristina-flaschen\">Cristina Flaschen</h5> <p>Cristina Flaschen is the CEO and co-founder of Pandium.

They’re joined by Elliott Abraham and Jason Bisson who start the interview explaining that they created the CLAM framework to help customers use Google Cloud security features to their fullest potential to create safe projects and relaxed clients.</p> <p>The CLAM (Cloud Logging Alerting and Monitoring) framework came about specifically to help customers transition products to, and run products securely in, the cloud.

BeyondCorp is Google’s answer to allowing employees to use company networks on any device while outside the building in a way that is both secure and efficient. Users are authenticated per session and per device to give access only to the specific person, on the specific device, for the specific job each time. In addition to the thorough authentication process, BeyondCorp continues to monitor device metadata during use as part of the system’s decision to continue to trust (or not trust) a user. With this information, if a user accidentally exposes the system to malware, for example, access can be revoked quickly.</p> <p>Max and Rob explain the steps Google went through to create such a state-of-the-art security program and give tips on how companies can build something similar. Codifying your employees’ needs and preferences, detailing the levels of trust you’ll allow, and thinking ahead about where in the world your employees will be when they access the system are some of their tips. Rob stresses how complicated the system was to build from scratch and emphasizes that with BeyondCorp Remote Access, companies don’t have to build a whole new system.</p> <p>BeyondCorp Remote Access offers automatic scaling and world-wide points of presence for a fast user experience anywhere in the world. Companies can define access rules for each user, setting trust levels and parameters for who can access what parts of the network. Rob points out that this is a great solution, not only for employees who find themselves working from home due to the current global climate, but also for freelance or contract workers who only need access to parts of the internal system.</p> <h5 id=\"rob-sadowski\">Rob Sadowski</h5> <p>Rob Sadowski is the Trust & Security Product Lead for Google Cloud at Google.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pvergadia\">Priyanka Vergadia</a> hops back into the host seat this week, joining <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> to talk to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaritRodevand\">Marit Rødevand</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/striseai\">Strise</a>. Strise is an AI-driven enterprise company using knowledge graphs to gather and analyze massive amounts of information, depositing it into a web-based interface to help large clients such as banks solve data-driven problems. Strise’s web-based data platform is customizable, flexible, and capable of keeping up with the fast-paced world of technology so enterprise companies aren’t constantly putting time and resources into reworking old or building new software. To do this, Strise uses knowledge graphs rather than typical databases to create what Marit calls a future-proof data model.</p> <p>Marit explains knowledge graphs in detail, emphasizing that they can reduce training of machine models, allow new data to be input easily, and make analyzing unstructured data much easier. Knowledge graphs take data that would normally only make sense to humans and in effect translate it for computers. Using banking as an example, she details how information about customers can be collected and analyzed thoroughly to help the bank come to conclusions about credit-worthiness or possible criminal activity.</p> <p>On Strise’s platform, Marit tells us that the information is now available to the end user who provides feedback to the system, marking things as relevant or irrelevant, rather than leaving those decisions to a data scientist outside of the client’s field. This means that massive amounts of information could be stored in the knowledge graph, across many industries, and each user only gets the data he or she needs.</p> <p>Google Cloud tools such as Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, and Pub/Sub have played an integral roll in the creation of the Strise data pipeline. Marit explains how Strise gets their data, how it’s input into the knowledge graph, and how these Google tools help to keep Strise running.</p> <h5 id=\"marit-rødevand\">Marit Rødevand</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaritRodevand\">Marit Rødevand</a> is the CEO & co-founder of Strise, an AI startup from Norway who is signaling a new era of enterprise software.</p> <p>Strise makes the world’s information useful across the enterprise. Their novel approach by utilizing a knowledge graph to power their data platform, allows Strise to break data silos, end customization projects, and bring new insights from unstructured data. Strise is currently helping leading Nordic banks and financial institutions to solve their hardest data-driven problems within KYC/AML, risk, and sales.</p> <p>Strise recently announced their Seed round from Maki.vc, the leading Nordic early stage investor, who invests in deep tech & brand-led startups.</p> <p>Marit has a background from Cybernetics & Robotics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). In university, she co-founded Rendra, a construction SaaS, who was later acquired. Marit started as Entrepreneur in Residence at NTNU where she spun Strise out of a research project that focused on new data models as a foundation for better AI.</p> <h5 id=\"cool-things-of-the-week\">Cool things of the week</h5> <ul> <li>BakeML <a href=\"https://whatareyoubaking.com\">site</a> <ul> <li>David East’s Firebase Podcast <a href= \"http://firebasepodcast.googledevelopers.libsynpro.com\">podcast</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Automating BigQuery exports to an email <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/automating-bigquery-exports-to-an-email\"> blog</a></li> <li>Cloud OnBoard <a href= \"https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/noram-may-cloudonboard\">site</a></li> </ul> <h5 id=\"interview\">Interview</h5> <ul> <li>Strise <a href=\"https://strise.ai\">site</a></li> <li>A world in text — Strise <a href= \"https://medium.com/strise/a-world-in-text-strise-12209ec20445\">blog</a></li> <li>GKE <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine\">site</a></li> <li>Helm <a href=\"https://helm.sh\">sote</a></li> <li>Dataproc <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/dataproc\">site</a></li> <li>Operations <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/products/operations\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Run <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/run\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Pub/Sub <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/pubsub\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud DNS <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dns\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Storage <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/storage\">site</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 198: SeMI Technologies with Laura Ham <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-198-semi-technologies-with-laura-ham/\"> podcast</a></li> <li>Building on Google Cloud with SeMI Technologies - Stack Chat <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrl_MmHVzUY\">video</a></li> <li>Knowledge graphs with Weaviate - Stack Chat <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrl_MmHVzUY\">video</a></li> <li>Natural Language Data Processing with Mito.ai - Stack Chat <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eCJBIZikVI\">video</a></li> </ul> <h5 id=\"question-of-the-week\">Question of the week</h5> <p>Zach answers the question “What’s a cool thing in Cloud that many people may not have thought about?” <a href= \"https://gsuite.google.com\">GSuite</a> and <a href= \"https://developers.google.com/apps-script\">Apps Script</a></p> <h5 id=\"what-s-something-cool-you-re-working-on\">What’s something cool you’re working on?</h5> <p>Priyanka wrote this post on <a href= \"https://medium.com/google-cloud/13-most-common-google-cloud-reference-architectures-23630b46326d\"> 13 Most Common Google Cloud Reference Architectures</a> and her parents were <a href= \"https://twitter.com/pvergadia/status/1259322212512722947\">on the news</a> for the vegetable garden they’ve been working on.

Using banking as an example, she details how information about customers can be collected and analyzed thoroughly to help the bank come to conclusions about credit-worthiness or possible criminal activity.</p> <p>On Strise’s platform, Marit tells us that the information is now available to the end user who provides feedback to the system, marking things as relevant or irrelevant, rather than leaving those decisions to a data scientist outside of the client’s field. This means that massive amounts of information could be stored in the knowledge graph, across many industries, and each user only gets the data he or she needs.</p> <p>Google Cloud tools such as Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, and Pub/Sub have played an integral roll in the creation of the Strise data pipeline. Marit explains how Strise gets their data, how it’s input into the knowledge graph, and how these Google tools help to keep Strise running.</p> Marit Rødevand <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaritRodevand\">Marit Rødevand</a> is the CEO & co-founder of Strise, an AI startup from Norway who is signaling a new era of enterprise software.</p> <p>Strise makes the world’s information useful across the enterprise. Their novel approach by utilizing a knowledge graph to power their data platform, allows Strise to break data silos, end customization projects, and bring new insights from unstructured data. Strise is currently helping leading Nordic banks and financial institutions to solve their hardest data-driven problems within KYC/AML, risk, and sales.</p> <p>Strise recently announced their Seed round from Maki.vc, the leading Nordic early stage investor, who invests in deep tech & brand-led startups.</p> <p>Marit has a background from Cybernetics & Robotics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). In university, she co-founded Rendra, a construction SaaS, who was later acquired. Marit started as Entrepreneur in Residence at NTNU where she spun Strise out of a research project that focused on new data models as a foundation for better AI.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>BakeML <a href=\"https://whatareyoubaking.com\">site</a> <ul> <li>David East’s Firebase Podcast <a href= \"http://firebasepodcast.googledevelopers.libsynpro.com\">podcast</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Automating BigQuery exports to an email <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/automating-bigquery-exports-to-an-email\"> blog</a></li> <li>Cloud OnBoard <a href= \"https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/noram-may-cloudonboard\">site</a></li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li>Strise <a href=\"https://strise.ai\">site</a></li> <li>A world in text — Strise <a href= \"https://medium.com/strise/a-world-in-text-strise-12209ec20445\">blog</a></li> <li>GKE <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine\">site</a></li> <li>Helm <a href=\"https://helm.sh\">sote</a></li> <li>Dataproc <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/dataproc\">site</a></li> <li>Operations <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/products/operations\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Run <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/run\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Pub/Sub <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/pubsub\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud DNS <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dns\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Storage <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/storage\">site</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 198: SeMI Technologies with Laura Ham <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-198-semi-technologies-with-laura-ham/\"> podcast</a></li> <li>Building on Google Cloud with SeMI Technologies - Stack Chat <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrl_MmHVzUY\">video</a></li> <li>Knowledge graphs with Weaviate - Stack Chat <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrl_MmHVzUY\">video</a></li> <li>Natural Language Data Processing with Mito.ai - Stack Chat <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eCJBIZikVI\">video</a></li> </ul> Question of the week <p>Zach answers the question “What’s a cool thing in Cloud that many people may not have thought about?” <a href= \"https://gsuite.google.com\">GSuite</a> and <a href= \"https://developers.google.com/apps-script\">Apps Script</a></p> What’s something cool you’re working on? <p>Priyanka wrote this post on <a href= \"https://medium.com/google-cloud/13-most-common-google-cloud-reference-architectures-23630b46326d\"> 13 Most Common Google Cloud Reference Architectures</a> and her parents were <a href= \"https://twitter.com/pvergadia/status/1259322212512722947\">on the news</a> for the vegetable garden they’ve been working on.

Justin and Pathik, both of the Professional Services Organization, work to help customers get the most out of GCP while maintaining their project budgets. They help customers take business success metrics and track them from a cost perspective, allowing the client to get an understanding of how much each business goal actually costs, rather than an aggregate of how much has been spent in total.

      "description": "<p>Emily Cai of Google is on the podcast today with hosts <a href= \"https://twitter.com/briandorsey\">Brian Dorsey</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> to talk about Kubernetes Config Connector, which went GA last month. The program helps users manage their Google Cloud resources in a way that is familiar for Kubernetes developers. Emily explains that it’s a great tool for Kubernetes developers looking to easily manage their infrastructure in one place. A platform team managing other teams is a perfect example of large-scale companies who could benefit from this tool, Emily explains.</p> <p>Walking listeners through the development cycle before and after Kubernetes Config Connector, Emily shines some light on specific instances when this powerful tool could streamline the process of building your project, making it faster and more efficient.

Her team’s goal is to help developers escape scripting hell and smoothly enter the world of continuous delivery. In 2014 while studying she dove into Lithuania’s tech hub seeking to promote IT education nationwide. After finishing her studies she landed in Berlin’s tech scene and began working with 200+ dev teams across Europe analysing their processes and helping to improve workflows. During this period Domile became fascinated by the struggles that tech teams face working with cloud technologies. She envisioned building a product that helps developers optimize their workflows and reduce cognitive load.

First up, Zack explains some of the ways AutoML Vision and Video can be used to make life easier. One example is how Google Photos are automatically tagged, allowing them to be searchable thanks to AutoML. Developers can also train their own AutoML to detect specific scenarios, such as laughing in a video.</p> <p>We also talk Cloud Next 2019 and learn how Zack comes up with ideas for his cool demos. His goal is to inspire people to incorporate machine learning into their projects, so he tries to combine hardware and exciting technology to think of fun, creative ways developers can use ML. Recently, he made a smart AI bicycle that alerts riders of possible danger behind them through a system of lights and a project to track and photograph balls as they fly through the air after being kicked.</p> <p>To wrap it all up, Zack tells us about some cool projects he’s heard people use AutoML for (like bleeping out tv show spoilers in online videos!) and the future of the software.</p> <h5 id=\"zack-akil\">Zack Akil</h5> <p>When he’s not teaching machine learning at Google, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ZackAkil\">Zack</a> likes to teach machine learning at his hands-on data science meetup, Central London Data Science Project Nights.

This week, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/the_thagomizer\">Aja</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/briandorsey\">Brian</a> are talking DevOps with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nathenharvey\">Nathen Harvey</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jezhumble\">Jez Humble</a>. Our guests thoroughly explain what DevOps is and why it’s important. DevOps purposely has no official definition but can be thought of as a community of practice that aims to make large-scale systems reliable and secure. It’s also a way to get developers and operations to work together to focus on the needs of the customer.</p> <p>Nathen later tells us all about DevOpsDays, a series of locally organized conferences occurring in cities around the world. The main goal is to bring a cross-functional group of people together to talk about how they can improve IT, DevOps, business strategy, and consider cultural changes the organization might benefit from. DevOpsDays supports this by only planning content for half the conference, then turning over the other half to attendees via Open Spaces. At this time, conference-goers are welcome to propose a topic and start a conversation.</p> <p>Jez then describes the Accelerate State of DevOps Report, how it came to be, and why it’s so useful. It includes items like building security into the software, testing continuously, ideal management practices, product development practices, and more. With the help of the DevOps Quick Check, you can discover the places your company could use some help and then refer back to the report for suggestions of improvements in those areas.</p> <h5 id=\"nathen-harvey\">Nathen Harvey</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nathenharvey\">Nathen Harvey</a> helps the community understand and apply DevOps and SRE practices in the cloud.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/the_thagomizer\">Aja</a> host our guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindydonna\">Donna Malayeri</a> this week to learn all about Cloud Run and Anthos! Designed to provide serverless containers, Cloud Run has two versions: fully managed and Cloud Run for Anthos.</p> <p>Donna’s passion for serverless projects and containers shows as we discuss how these options benefit developers and customers. With containers, developers are able to go serverless without a lot of the typical restrictions, and because they are a standard format, containers are fairly easy to learn to use. Tools such as Ko can even do the work of generating docker containers for you. One of Cloud Run’s most unique features is that it allows developers to bring existing applications. You don’t have to rewrite your entire app to make it serverless! Developers can also reuse instances, making the process more efficient and cost effective.</p> <p>Cloud Run for Anthos allows projects to stay on-prem while still enjoying the benefits of containers and the Cloud Run platform.</p> <p>Later in the show, Donna tells us about Knative, which is the API Cloud Run is based on that helps create portability between Cloud Run versions, as well as portability to other vendors. We also get to hear the weirdest things she’s seen put in a container and run in Cloud Run!</p> <h5 id=\"donna-malayeri\">Donna Malayeri</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindydonna\">Donna Malayeri</a> is a product manager for Cloud Run for Anthos.

Designed to provide serverless containers, Cloud Run has two versions: fully managed and Cloud Run for Anthos.</p> <p>Donna’s passion for serverless projects and containers shows as we discuss how these options benefit developers and customers. With containers, developers are able to go serverless without a lot of the typical restrictions, and because they are a standard format, containers are fairly easy to learn to use. Tools such as Ko can even do the work of generating docker containers for you. One of Cloud Run’s most unique features is that it allows developers to bring existing applications. You don’t have to rewrite your entire app to make it serverless! Developers can also reuse instances, making the process more efficient and cost effective.</p> <p>Cloud Run for Anthos allows projects to stay on-prem while still enjoying the benefits of containers and the Cloud Run platform.</p> <p>Later in the show, Donna tells us about Knative, which is the API Cloud Run is based on that helps create portability between Cloud Run versions, as well as portability to other vendors. We also get to hear the weirdest things she’s seen put in a container and run in Cloud Run!</p> Donna Malayeri <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindydonna\">Donna Malayeri</a> is a product manager for Cloud Run for Anthos.

      "description": "<p>Happy Halloween! Today, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon Foust</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/briandorsey\">Brian Dorsey</a> chat with <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-laura-scuri-43270689/\">Maria Laura Scuri</a> of FACEIT about ways they are reducing toxicity in gaming. FACEIT is a competitive gaming platform that helps connect gamers and game competition and tournament organizers. In order to do this well, FACEIT has put a lot of energy into finding ways to keep the experience positive for everyone.</p> <p>Because gaming toxicity can involve anything from verbal jabs to throwing a game, FACEIT uses a combination of data collecting programs and input from players to help identify toxic behavior. In identifying this behavior, FACEIT has to consider not only the literal words spoken or actions made, but the context around them. Is that player being rude to strangers or is he egging on a friend? The answer to this question could change the behavior from unacceptable to friendly banter. Using their own machine learning model, interactions are then given a score to determine how toxic the player was in that match.</p> <p>The toxicity scores along with their program, Minerva, determine if any bans should be put on a player. FACEIT focuses on punishing player behavior, rather than the player themselves, in an effort to help players learn from the experience and change the way they interact with others in the future.</p> <p>Maria’s advice to other companies looking to help reduce toxicity on their platforms is to know the context of the toxic event. Know how toxicity can express itself on your platform and find ways to deal with all of them. She also suggests tackling the issues of toxicity in small portions and celebrating the small wins! Her final piece of advice is to focus on criticizing the behavior of the user rather than attacking them personally.</p> <h5 id=\"maria-laura-scuri\">Maria Laura Scuri</h5> <p><a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-laura-scuri-43270689/\">Maria</a> is the Director of Business Intelligence at FACEIT, the leading competitive platform for online multiplayer games with over 15 million users. She joined FACEIT as part of the core team in 2013 as an intern assisting with everything from customer support to event management. Her passion for data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence saw her quickly rise through the ranks to her current position, leading the Business Intelligence and Data Science teams.</p> <p>Maria works side by side with some of the biggest tech companies in the world including Google Cloud. She is the main lead on a number of projects including the inception of an Artificial Intelligence Admin to fight toxicity on the platform. Maria is responsible for implementing best practices around data visualization and tools that allow the FACEIT team to thrive, as well as sourcing and training new talent.</p> <p>Maria is a huge video games fan. You can find her on League of Legends as “FACEIT Lulu” and on Steam as “<a href= \"https://steamcommunity.com/id/sephariel89/\">Sephariel</a>”.</p> <h5 id=\"cool-things-of-the-week\">Cool things of the week</h5> <ul> <li>What can Google Cloud do for you?

      "content:encoded": "<p>Happy Halloween! Today, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon Foust</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/briandorsey\">Brian Dorsey</a> chat with <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-laura-scuri-43270689/\">Maria Laura Scuri</a> of FACEIT about ways they are reducing toxicity in gaming. FACEIT is a competitive gaming platform that helps connect gamers and game competition and tournament organizers. In order to do this well, FACEIT has put a lot of energy into finding ways to keep the experience positive for everyone.</p> <p>Because gaming toxicity can involve anything from verbal jabs to throwing a game, FACEIT uses a combination of data collecting programs and input from players to help identify toxic behavior. In identifying this behavior, FACEIT has to consider not only the literal words spoken or actions made, but the context around them. Is that player being rude to strangers or is he egging on a friend? The answer to this question could change the behavior from unacceptable to friendly banter. Using their own machine learning model, interactions are then given a score to determine how toxic the player was in that match.</p> <p>The toxicity scores along with their program, Minerva, determine if any bans should be put on a player. FACEIT focuses on punishing player behavior, rather than the player themselves, in an effort to help players learn from the experience and change the way they interact with others in the future.</p> <p>Maria’s advice to other companies looking to help reduce toxicity on their platforms is to know the context of the toxic event. Know how toxicity can express itself on your platform and find ways to deal with all of them. She also suggests tackling the issues of toxicity in small portions and celebrating the small wins! Her final piece of advice is to focus on criticizing the behavior of the user rather than attacking them personally.</p> Maria Laura Scuri <p><a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-laura-scuri-43270689/\">Maria</a> is the Director of Business Intelligence at FACEIT, the leading competitive platform for online multiplayer games with over 15 million users. She joined FACEIT as part of the core team in 2013 as an intern assisting with everything from customer support to event management. Her passion for data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence saw her quickly rise through the ranks to her current position, leading the Business Intelligence and Data Science teams.</p> <p>Maria works side by side with some of the biggest tech companies in the world including Google Cloud. She is the main lead on a number of projects including the inception of an Artificial Intelligence Admin to fight toxicity on the platform. Maria is responsible for implementing best practices around data visualization and tools that allow the FACEIT team to thrive, as well as sourcing and training new talent.</p> <p>Maria is a huge video games fan. You can find her on League of Legends as “FACEIT Lulu” and on Steam as “<a href= \"https://steamcommunity.com/id/sephariel89/\">Sephariel</a>”.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>What can Google Cloud do for you?

At SeMI Technologies, Laura works with their project Weaviate, an open-source knowledge graph program that allows users to do a contextualized search based on inputted data. However, unlike traditional databases, Weaviate attaches meanings and links within the data.</p> <p>Laura details what knowledge graphs are and how they can be useful for both small and large projects. Explaining that ontology is the meaning of words, she tells us how Weaviate is able to use this concept to make more specific data entries and links, allowing users to perform better and more informative searches. Weaviate is able to do this with the help of Kubernetes. Later, Laura tells Gabi and Jon the ways Weaviate helps developers and users with thorough documentation, assistance with troubleshooting, and support from solution engineers.</p> <h5 id=\"laura-ham\">Laura Ham</h5> <p>Laura is the Community Solution Engineer at SeMI Technologies, where she takes care of building and supporting a community around their open source software product, Weaviate. She also takes care of the developer and user experience within the business, which means she writes documentation to support both developers and users, as well as researches and evaluates new software implementations on user experience. She has a user-centered approach in the work that she develops and designs. Laura is a full-time graduate student in Human Computer Interaction and Design with a special focus on Innovation and Entrepreneurship at EIT Digital Master School.

It uses monitoring systems to follow animals as they move about the field, then employs algorithms to identify any problems that may need attention.

When pitted against humans, HerdX’s AI system could pinpoint the problem livestock much faster and more accurately than people. Once problem livestock are found, the rancher can use that information to devise and implement a treatment plan. Consumers benefit from HerdX as well, through better quality meat and better transparency of rancher practices. The players in the supply chain are recorded and meat is monitored through the entire process, from farm, to feed lot, to the dinner table.

Before his time with HerdX, Ron had a number of immensely successful career paths and achievements as a serial entrepreneur, inventor, and a strong visionary who loves disruptive technologies that can change the world. He was distinguished with Business Week’s top industrial design award in Medical Technologies, which recognized him along with other leaders and companies throughout the world, including BMW, Sony, Logitech, and Ford Motor Company.

      "description": "<p>Happy Independence Day to our American listeners! <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark Mandel</a> is back today as he and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gabidavila\">Gabi Ferrara</a> interview Bill Creekbaum of Informatica to learn how they work with Google Cloud for a better big data user experience. <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> is hanging around the studio as well, bringing some cool things of the week and helping with the question of the week!</p> <p>Informatica provides data managing products that offer complete solutions focusing on metadata management, integration, governance, security, data quality, and discoverability. Bill’s job at Informatica is to ensure these products really take advantage of the strengths of Google Cloud Platform. One such example is a product that allows customers to design in Informatica and push their projects to Cloud Dataproc. Informatica also offers similar capabilities in BigQuery. When moving data from on-prem to the cloud, customers can use Informatica and Google Cloud together for a seamless transition, cost savings, and easier data control.</p> <p>Together, Informatica and Google Cloud can also facilitate the acquisition of high quality data. To have better, more trustworthy output, data inputed needs to be safe to access, have few or no duplicates and null values, and be complete. To achieve this, developers usually use a combination of the Informatica tools Intelligent Cloud Services, Enterprise Data Catalog, and Big Data Management, and the Google tools BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Analytics, Dataproc, and Pub/Sub.</p> <p>Bill’s closing advice for companies comes in three parts: take stock of the data you’ve got, set goals, and develop a well-rounded team.</p> <h5 id=\"bill-creekbaum\">Bill Creekbaum</h5> <p>Bill Creekbaum is Sr. Director of Product Management for Cloud, Big Data, and Analytic Ecosystems at Informatica. He is focused on delivering market leading unified data management platforms and services that help customers take advantage of their greatest assets, data. Bill has been in product management and product marketing for more than 20 years and for the past 10 has been focused on successfully delivering SaaS and Cloud Applications to the market.

Bill’s job at Informatica is to ensure these products really take advantage of the strengths of Google Cloud Platform. One such example is a product that allows customers to design in Informatica and push their projects to Cloud Dataproc. Informatica also offers similar capabilities in BigQuery. When moving data from on-prem to the cloud, customers can use Informatica and Google Cloud together for a seamless transition, cost savings, and easier data control.</p> <p>Together, Informatica and Google Cloud can also facilitate the acquisition of high quality data. To have better, more trustworthy output, data inputed needs to be safe to access, have few or no duplicates and null values, and be complete. To achieve this, developers usually use a combination of the Informatica tools Intelligent Cloud Services, Enterprise Data Catalog, and Big Data Management, and the Google tools BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Analytics, Dataproc, and Pub/Sub.</p> <p>Bill’s closing advice for companies comes in three parts: take stock of the data you’ve got, set goals, and develop a well-rounded team.</p> Bill Creekbaum <p>Bill Creekbaum is Sr. Director of Product Management for Cloud, Big Data, and Analytic Ecosystems at Informatica. He is focused on delivering market leading unified data management platforms and services that help customers take advantage of their greatest assets, data.

      "description": "<p>This week, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon Foust</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/texasmichelle\">Michelle Casbon</a> bring you another fascinating interview from our time at Next! Michelle and special guest Amanda were able to catch up with Paco Nathan of Derwen AI to talk about his experience at Next and learn what Derwen is doing to advance AI.</p> <p>Paco and Derwen have been working extensively on ways developer relations can be enhanced by machine learning. Along with O’Reilly Media, Derwen just completed three surveys, called ABC (AI, Big Data, and Cloud), to look at the adoption of AI and the cloud around the world. The particular interest in these studies is a comparison between countries who have been using AI, Big Data, and Cloud for years and countries who are just beginning to get involved. One of the most interesting things they learned is how much budget companies are allocating to machine learning projects. They also noticed that more and more large enterprises are moving, at least partially, to the cloud.</p> <p>One of the challenges Paco noticed was the difference between machine learning projects in testing versus how they act once they go live. Here, developers come across bias, ethical, and safety issues. Good data governance polices can help minimize these problems. Developing good data governance policies is complex, especially with security issues, but it’s an important conversation to have. In the process of computing the survey data, Paco discovered many big companies spend a lot of time with this issue and even employ checklists of requirements before projects can be made live.</p> <p>In his research, Paco also discovered that about 54% of companies are non-starters. Usually, their problems stem from tech debt and issues with company personnel who do not recognize the need for machine learning. The companies working toward integrating machine learning tend to have issues finding good staff. Berkeley is working to solve this problem by requiring data science classes of all students. But as Paco says, data science is a team sport that works well with a team of people from different disciplines. Paco is an advocate of mentoring, to help the next generation of data scientists learn and grow, and of unbundling corporate decision making to help advance AI.</p> <p>Amanda, Michelle, and Paco wrap up their discussion with a look toward how to change ML biases. People tend to blame ML for bias outcomes, but models are subject to data we feed in. Humans have to make decisions to work around that by looking at things from a different perspective and taking steps to avoid as much bias as we can. ML and humans can work together to find these biases and help remove them.</p> <h5 id=\"paco-nathan\">Paco Nathan</h5> <p>Paco Nathan is the Managing Parter at Derwen.

      "content:encoded": "<p>This week, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon Foust</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/texasmichelle\">Michelle Casbon</a> bring you another fascinating interview from our time at Next! Michelle and special guest Amanda were able to catch up with Paco Nathan of Derwen AI to talk about his experience at Next and learn what Derwen is doing to advance AI.</p> <p>Paco and Derwen have been working extensively on ways developer relations can be enhanced by machine learning. Along with O’Reilly Media, Derwen just completed three surveys, called ABC (AI, Big Data, and Cloud), to look at the adoption of AI and the cloud around the world. The particular interest in these studies is a comparison between countries who have been using AI, Big Data, and Cloud for years and countries who are just beginning to get involved. One of the most interesting things they learned is how much budget companies are allocating to machine learning projects. They also noticed that more and more large enterprises are moving, at least partially, to the cloud.</p> <p>One of the challenges Paco noticed was the difference between machine learning projects in testing versus how they act once they go live. Here, developers come across bias, ethical, and safety issues. Good data governance polices can help minimize these problems. Developing good data governance policies is complex, especially with security issues, but it’s an important conversation to have. In the process of computing the survey data, Paco discovered many big companies spend a lot of time with this issue and even employ checklists of requirements before projects can be made live.</p> <p>In his research, Paco also discovered that about 54% of companies are non-starters. Usually, their problems stem from tech debt and issues with company personnel who do not recognize the need for machine learning. The companies working toward integrating machine learning tend to have issues finding good staff. Berkeley is working to solve this problem by requiring data science classes of all students. But as Paco says, data science is a team sport that works well with a team of people from different disciplines. Paco is an advocate of mentoring, to help the next generation of data scientists learn and grow, and of unbundling corporate decision making to help advance AI.</p> <p>Amanda, Michelle, and Paco wrap up their discussion with a look toward how to change ML biases. People tend to blame ML for bias outcomes, but models are subject to data we feed in. Humans have to make decisions to work around that by looking at things from a different perspective and taking steps to avoid as much bias as we can. ML and humans can work together to find these biases and help remove them.</p> Paco Nathan <p>Paco Nathan is the Managing Parter at Derwen.

As Angela describes Google Maps at a high level, it is your window into the real world, with coverage of Earth’s land and oceans. Google works hard to keep that information updated with satellite pictures, street view Google vehicles, and even backpacks for hikers to record hard to reach areas.</p> <p>The Google Maps API makes it easy for developers to use Maps data in their own projects. It can be used for something as simple as showing location to something more complicated, for example showing the user specific things around them to help them make decisions. Game developers can create rich experiences by building real-world gaming situations with Maps and augmented reality. Using the Places API can display parks, government buildings, and other interesting places beyond streets. And the Routes API can expand the user experience by providing directions, tracking drivers in real time, etc. Maps and Google Cloud together work well with BigQuery to search huge amounts of data and visualize them on a map.</p> <p>In the future, Angela is particularly excited about how ridesharing apps will continue to use Maps and Routes to optimize their businesses.

Firebase is a suite of products that helps developers build apps. According to Jen, it’s equivalent to the client-side of Google Cloud. Firebase works across platforms, including Android, web, iOS and offers many growth features, setting it apart from other Google products. It helps site and app owners interact with and reach customers with services like notifications, remote configurations to optimize the app, testing, and more.</p> <p>Cloud Firestore has come out of beta, and it is available both through Firebase and Google Cloud Platform, making it easy for developers to move from one to the other if their needs change.</p> <p>Recently, the Firebase team has been working to refine their products based on user feedback. Firebase Authentication has been upgraded with the additions of phone authentication, email link authentication, and multiple email actions. They’ve also added a generic authentication option so developers can use any provider they choose.</p> <p>ML Kit makes machine learning much easier for client apps or on the server. With on-device ML features, users can continue using the app without internet service. Things like face recognition can still be done quickly without a wifi connection. ML Kit is adding new features all the time, including smart reply and translation, image labeling , facial feature detection, etc.</p> <p>Cloud Functions for Firebase is also out of beta. It includes new features like a crash-litics trigger that can notify you if your site or app crashes and scheduled functions.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon Foust</a> is back this week, joining <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> for an in-depth look at <a href= \"https://twitter.com/stackdriver\">Stackdriver</a> with fellow Googler, Rory Petty. To start, Product Manager Rory explains that Stackdriver is a full observability solution for Google Cloud (as well as other clouds). We touch on how monitoring, logging, and APM tools allow developers and operators to fully understand how a website is performing. In addition to Monitoring and Logging, the suite of Stackdriver tools also includes Debugger, Trace, and Profiler to help users not only monitor their sites, but to solve problems that occur.</p> <p>Stackdriver Monitoring and Logging support Google Cloud services out of the box. Users can use Monitoring to set up alerts, so if something goes awry, they are notified immediately and can address the problem. Alerts can also be custom designed to inform developers of things like number of checkouts on your e-commerce site, the amount of time between checkouts, and more. Stackdriver Monitoring allows blackbox monitoring, too, to make sure your service is healthy. The Monitoring dashboard makes it really easy to get started, with a resources section that has pre-made dashboards for developers to use. Developers don’t have to do a lot of configuration out of the box. However, if you need a more customized dashboard, that is also possible in Stackdriver Monitoring.</p> <p>At Cloud Next earlier this year, Stackdriver announced Service Monitoring in alpha, which shows users a map of their microservices architecture. Public beta will hopefully be later this year. Stackdriver Sandbox, another recent project currently in the alpha stage, gives people an easy way to configure a test Stackdriver environment. This way, developers can play with Stackdriver tools without effecting their websites. Stackdriver Profiler, a great tool to understand the performance of your system, went GA at Cloud Next as well.</p> <p>Stackdriver’s tools are all meant to work together to help you maintain and perfect development projects on many different cloud services and on-prem.</p> <h5 id=\"rory-petty\">Rory Petty</h5> <p>Rory Petty is Product Manager for the Stackdriver Monitoring Platform.

PSO is the “post sales” department, helping clients come up with solutions for security, data migration, AI, ML, and more. Listen in to this episode to learn more about the specifics of the PSO!</p> <h5 id=\"ann-wallace\">Ann Wallace</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/annnwallace\">Ann Wallace</a> is the Global Security Practice Lead for Google PSO. She has spent the last 6 months building out the security practice. Ann is passionate about inclusion in tech. She is the West regional lead for Google Cloud EDII and a volunteer with Women Who Code Portland. Before Google Ann spent 14 years at Nike in various engineering and architecture roles. CloudNOW named her one of the top 10 Women in Cloud in 2015. When not working, Ann can be found ultra-trail running around the world.</p> <h5 id=\"michael-wallman\">Michael Wallman</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/@berkeleyboo\">Michael Wallman</a> is a TPM, working on Cloud Migration for internal Alphabet companies and acquisitions. He also serves as the America’s infrastructure practice lead. He is in his 3rd year at Google. Prior to Google, Michael is Cloud “OG”, and spent almost 5 years growing the AWS Professional Services organization from 5 to 700+. Before sticking his head in the clouds, Michael helped found 2 start-ups: Aspera and SensysNetworks. Outside of work Michael spends his time chasing his 2 toddlers and mountain lions around the Berkeley Hills.</p> <p>Ann and Michael actually met 5 years ago, working on Nike’s first cloud migration project.

PSO is the “post sales” department, helping clients come up with solutions for security, data migration, AI, ML, and more. Listen in to this episode to learn more about the specifics of the PSO!</p> Ann Wallace <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/annnwallace\">Ann Wallace</a> is the Global Security Practice Lead for Google PSO. She has spent the last 6 months building out the security practice. Ann is passionate about inclusion in tech. She is the West regional lead for Google Cloud EDII and a volunteer with Women Who Code Portland. Before Google Ann spent 14 years at Nike in various engineering and architecture roles. CloudNOW named her one of the top 10 Women in Cloud in 2015. When not working, Ann can be found ultra-trail running around the world.</p> Michael Wallman <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/@berkeleyboo\">Michael Wallman</a> is a TPM, working on Cloud Migration for internal Alphabet companies and acquisitions. He also serves as the America’s infrastructure practice lead. He is in his 3rd year at Google. Prior to Google, Michael is Cloud “OG”, and spent almost 5 years growing the AWS Professional Services organization from 5 to 700+. Before sticking his head in the clouds, Michael helped found 2 start-ups: Aspera and SensysNetworks. Outside of work Michael spends his time chasing his 2 toddlers and mountain lions around the Berkeley Hills.</p> <p>Ann and Michael actually met 5 years ago, working on Nike’s first cloud migration project. This encompassed reverse engineering a custom Perl configuration management system. (Who doesn’t love Perl?)

      "description": "<p>We’re learning all about Cloud SQL this week with our guest, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amykrishnamohan\">Amy Krishnamohan</a>. Amy’s main job is to teach customers about the products she represents. Today, she explains to <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/gabidavila\">Gabi</a> that Cloud SQL manages services for open source databases, and she spends a little time elaborating on the other database management services Google has to offer.</p> <p>Cloud SQL is a relational data storage solution. Relational data storage is very structured, almost like a table or spreadsheet, making it easier to analyze the data. Cloud SQL is capable of scaling out and up, meaning it can scale for traffic patterns and for storage. In comparison, NoSQL databases are very unstructured. If you’re not sure what kind of data is coming in, you can sort the data first and analyze it later. Each approach has its pros and cons and each is suitable for different types of projects.</p> <p>Recently, Cloud SQL released a feature making it easy to move from on-prem to the cloud.

Amy’s main job is to teach customers about the products she represents. Today, she explains to <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/gabidavila\">Gabi</a> that Cloud SQL manages services for open source databases, and she spends a little time elaborating on the other database management services Google has to offer.</p> <p>Cloud SQL is a relational data storage solution. Relational data storage is very structured, almost like a table or spreadsheet, making it easier to analyze the data. Cloud SQL is capable of scaling out and up, meaning it can scale for traffic patterns and for storage. In comparison, NoSQL databases are very unstructured. If you’re not sure what kind of data is coming in, you can sort the data first and analyze it later. Each approach has its pros and cons and each is suitable for different types of projects.</p> <p>Recently, Cloud SQL released a feature making it easy to move from on-prem to the cloud.

It is a serverless compute product that supports many programming languages, scales automatically, and only charges for what you use.

Cloud Functions also works well between clouds or even Google Cloud services, acting as the glue between them.</p> <p>Go Cloud Functions works specifically for Go.

It is a serverless compute product that supports many programming languages, scales automatically, and only charges for what you use. It works best as event-driven computing, in other words, when something happens, you want something else to happen in response. Cloud Functions also works well between clouds or even Google Cloud services, acting as the glue between them.</p> <p>Go Cloud Functions works specifically for Go. Google makes a huge effort to make Cloud Functions easy to use for all developers, so that no matter what language you’re familiar with, Cloud Functions works for you.</p> Stewart Reichling <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stewblr\">Stewart Reichling</a> is the lead Product Manager on Google Cloud Functions.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nyghtowl\">Melanie</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> talk with Google Cloud’s VP of Engineering, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmeckf\">Melody Meckfessel</a>, this week. In her time with Google Cloud, she and her team have worked to uncover what makes developers more productive. The main focus of their work is DevOps, defined by Melody as automation around the developer workflow and culture. In other words, Melody and her team are discovering new ways for developers to interact and how those interactions can encourage their productive peak.</p> <p>Melody and her team have used their internal research and expanded it to collaborate with Google Cloud partners and open source projects.

We touch on tensors, their use, and how they relate to TensorFlow. Anima also details the work she does with NVIDIA and how they are helping to advance machine learning through hardware and software. Our main discussion centers around AI and machine learning research conferences, specifically the Neural Information Processing Systems conference (commonly referred to as NIPS) and the reason they have rebranded.</p> <p>NIPS originally started as a small conference at Caltech. As deep learning became more and more popular, it grew exponentially. With the higher attendance and interest, the acronym became center stage. Sexual innuendos and harassing puns surrounded the conference, sparking a call for a name change. At first, conference organizers were reluctant to rebrand and they used recent survey results as a reason to keep NIPS.</p> <p>Anima discusses her personal experience protesting the acronym, opening up about the hate speech and threats of which she and others received. Despite the harassment, Anima and others continued to protest, petition, and share stories of mistreatment within the community which helped lead to the name/acronym change to NeurIPS.

On this episode, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/nyghtowl\">Melanie</a> learn about <a href= \"https://twitter.com/gracehealth_\">Grace.health</a> with co-founders <a href=\"https://twitter.com/teddschen\">Therese Mannheimer</a> and Roman Jasins. Grace.health’s goal is to give women control of information about their own bodies, allowing them to make informed healthcare decisions. Grace.health is a female health companion that lets women track and plan their periods, fertility, and ask questions. It is a global undertaking, hoping to reach not just the tech savvy woman, but all women in all markets worldwide.</p> <p>Stigmas and taboos around the world portray periods as dirty and contagious, preventing women from being able to work, go to school, or even sleep in the house.

KF gives her perspective on Strange Loop, working remotely, and distributed systems. She compliments Strange Loop for the diversity it has achieved as the conference has grown. She laments the lack of introductory material for distributed systems learners, saying it’s not as complicated as everyone thinks but needs more educational material for beginners! In general, she believes everyone could benefit from some code study, especially if you can find a good mentor. KF also gives us some great tips for working remotely and staying effective and social.</p> <h5 id=\"katherine-fellows\">Katherine Fellows</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kf\">KF</a> is a senior engineer focusing on backend, infrastructure, and data engineering.

KF gives her perspective on Strange Loop, working remotely, and distributed systems. She compliments Strange Loop for the diversity it has achieved as the conference has grown. She laments the lack of introductory material for distributed systems learners, saying it’s not as complicated as everyone thinks but needs more educational material for beginners! In general, she believes everyone could benefit from some code study, especially if you can find a good mentor. KF also gives us some great tips for working remotely and staying effective and social.</p> Katherine Fellows <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kf\">KF</a> is a senior engineer focusing on backend, infrastructure, and data engineering.

      "description": "<p>In our last (but not least!) interview from NEXT, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/nyghtowl\">Melanie</a> talked with Sivan Aldor-Noiman and Erik Andrejko about <a href= \"https://twitter.com/getwellio\">Wellio</a>, an awesome new platform that combines AI and healthy eating. Wellio was developed as a way to not only educate users on the importance of proper nutrition for well-being but to give them their own personal nutritionist.</p> <p>The data scientists at Wellio started from scratch (pun intended) to create their own food-related database and then began training models so the data could be organized and personalized. Using a combination of human power and machine learning techniques, Wellio learns your preferences, allergies, diets, etc. and will make healthy decisions for you based on these key facts. It chooses recipes, populates a grocery list, and even has the ingredients delivered to your door in time for dinner!</p> <h5 id=\"sivan-aldor-noiman\">Sivan Aldor-Noiman</h5> <p>Sivan heads Data Science for Wellio, an early stage startup in the FoodTech space that is helping people eat better. In Wellio, her team delivers models that help inspire, empower and adapt to people’s eating needs, cooking abilities and health constraints. She began her career in the Israeli military serving as an instructor for an anti-tank missile unit (please don’t think Rambo, think more like a classroom teacher). Sivan then transitioned to school and received her undergraduate degree in Industrial Engineering and a Master in Statistics from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. She moved to the U.S. to complete a Ph.D. degree in Statistics from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. In her previous job, Sivan ended up leading several Data Science teams and learned that she really liked leading technical people since she got to learn a lot from them. Ultimately, she missed the smaller company mentality, so she is back in the startup world. Sivan was once asked to define herself so here goes: “I am an enthusiastic disagreeable giver and a constant empirical driven learner”.</p> <h5 id=\"erik-andrejko\">Erik Andrejko</h5> <p>Erik has spent his career making a positive impact on the world through mathematics.

      "content:encoded": "<p>In our last (but not least!) interview from NEXT, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/nyghtowl\">Melanie</a> talked with Sivan Aldor-Noiman and Erik Andrejko about <a href= \"https://twitter.com/getwellio\">Wellio</a>, an awesome new platform that combines AI and healthy eating. Wellio was developed as a way to not only educate users on the importance of proper nutrition for well-being but to give them their own personal nutritionist.</p> <p>The data scientists at Wellio started from scratch (pun intended) to create their own food-related database and then began training models so the data could be organized and personalized. Using a combination of human power and machine learning techniques, Wellio learns your preferences, allergies, diets, etc. and will make healthy decisions for you based on these key facts. It chooses recipes, populates a grocery list, and even has the ingredients delivered to your door in time for dinner!</p> Sivan Aldor-Noiman <p>Sivan heads Data Science for Wellio, an early stage startup in the FoodTech space that is helping people eat better. In Wellio, her team delivers models that help inspire, empower and adapt to people’s eating needs, cooking abilities and health constraints. She began her career in the Israeli military serving as an instructor for an anti-tank missile unit (please don’t think Rambo, think more like a classroom teacher). Sivan then transitioned to school and received her undergraduate degree in Industrial Engineering and a Master in Statistics from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. She moved to the U.S. to complete a Ph.D. degree in Statistics from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. In her previous job, Sivan ended up leading several Data Science teams and learned that she really liked leading technical people since she got to learn a lot from them. Ultimately, she missed the smaller company mentality, so she is back in the startup world. Sivan was once asked to define herself so here goes: “I am an enthusiastic disagreeable giver and a constant empirical driven learner”.</p> Erik Andrejko <p>Erik has spent his career making a positive impact on the world through mathematics. He is a co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Wellio - an early stage startup applying AI to the intersection of food and human health. Previously, Erik lead the data science and research organization at The Climate Corporation, which applies data science to solve challenging problems in numerous domains including climatology, agronomic modeling and geospatial applications. When not analyzing interesting datasets, Erik can often be found riding up some incline on a bicycle or cooking.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>Summary of Google Cloud Next Tokyo <a href= \"https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next18/tokyo\">site</a></li> <li>Deep Learning Indaba GCP Credit Awards <a href= \"https://twitter.com/DeepIndaba/status/1040561702910263297\">site</a></li> <li>Data Studio and Dataprep are now generally available <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/unlock-insights-with-ease-data-studio-and-cloud-dataprep-are-now-generally-available\"> blog</a> <ul> <li>DS: BI analyze <a href= \"https://datastudio.google.com/data\">more than 500 other data sources</a> via more than 100 partner-built connectors and used by over a million people globally</li> <li>DP: new look, team collab and more analytics features <a href= \"https://www.trifacta.com/blog/announcing-general-availability-google-cloud-dataprep-trifacta/\"> blog</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Announcing general availability of Cloud Memorystore for Redis <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/announcing-general-availability-of-cloud-memorystore-for-redis\"> blog</a></li> <li>Coursera Advanced Machine Learning with TensorFlow with GCP <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/training-certifications/now-on-coursera-advanced-machine-learning-with-tensorflow-on-google-cloud-platform\"> blog</a> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/americas\">Webinar</a> on October 9th at 9AM PST to learn more</li> </ul> </li> <li>Simplifying ML predictions with Google Cloud Functions <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/simplifying-ml-predictions-with-google-cloud-functions\"> blog</a></li> <li>50 Best Cloud Security Podcasts <a href= \"https://securityboulevard.com/2018/09/50-best-cloud-security-podcasts/\"> site</a> <ul> <li>GCP Podcast Episode #100: Vint Cerf: past, present, and future of the internet <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-100-vint-cerf/\">podcast</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li>Wellio <a href=\"http://www.getwellio.com/\">site</a></li> <li>GKE <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Storage <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/storage/\">site</a></li> <li>Pub/Sub <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Composer <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/composer/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud ML Engine <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/\">site</a></li> <li>Stackdriver <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Functions <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/functions/\">site</a></li> <li>TensorFlow <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org\">site</a></li> <li>Keras <a href=\"https://keras.io\">site</a></li> <li>Scikit Learn <a href= \"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud TPU <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud AutoML <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/automl/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Vision <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/vision/\">site</a></li> <li>DevOps201 for Application Developers <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzE-zNX67w0&list=PLBgogxgQVM9v0xG0QTFQ5PTbNrj8uGSS-&index=221&t=0s\"> video</a></li> <li>Cloud Firestore <a href= \"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/\">site</a></li> <li>Day 3 Keynote: Made Here Together <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQPOPV_VH5w&index=337&t=0s&list=PLBgogxgQVM9v0xG0QTFQ5PTbNrj8uGSS-\"> video</a></li> <li>Spinnaker <a href=\"https://www.spinnaker.io\">site</a></li> <li>Contact Wellio <a href= \"mailto:%20sivan@getwellio.com\">email</a></li> </ul> Questions of the week <p>Is Inbox going away?</p> <ul> <li>Inbox is signing off: find your favorite features in the new Gmail <a href= \"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/inbox-signing-find-your-favorite-features-new-gmail/\"> blog</a></li> <li>5 ways the new Gmail can help you get more done <a href= \"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/5-ways-new-gmail-can-help-you-get-more-done/\"> blog</a></li> </ul> Where can you find us next? <p>We’ll both be at <a href= \"https://www.thestrangeloop.com\">Strangeloop</a>.</p> <p>Mark will probably be at <a href= \"https://unite.unity.com/2018/los-angeles\">Unite L.A.</a> in October.</p> <p>Melanie speaking at <a href= \"https://monktoberfest.com/\">Monktoberfest</a> Oct 4th in Portland, Maine.</p>",

Bottom line - we need one solution that works for all.</p> <h5 id=\"haben-girma\">Haben Girma</h5> <p>The first Deafblind person to graduate from Harvard Law School, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HabenGirma\">Haben Girma</a> advocates for equal opportunities for people with disabilities. President Obama named her a White House Champion of Change, and Forbes recognized her in Forbes 30 Under 30. Haben travels the world consulting and public speaking, teaching clients the benefits of fully accessible products and services. Haben is a talented storyteller who helps people frame difference as an asset. She resisted society’s low expectations, choosing to create her own pioneering story.

At Project Jupyter, she works primarily on JupyterHub, Binder, and JuptyerLab to improve access to scientific computing and scientific research. Her previous open source projects include datamicroscopes, a DARPA-funded Bayesian nonparametrics library in Python, and density, a wireless device data tool at Columbia University.

He works on making it easy for people who don’t traditionally consider themselves “programmers” to do things with code. He builds tools (e.g., Quarry, PAWS, etc.) to sidestep the list of historical accidents that constitute the “command line tax” that people have to pay before doing productive things with computing.</p> <h5 id=\"chris-holdgraf\">Chris Holdgraf</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/choldgraf\">Chris Holdgraf</a> is a is a Project Jupyter Maintainer and Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and a Community Architect at the Data Science Education Program at UC Berkeley. His background is in cognitive and computational neuroscience, where he used predictive models to understand the auditory system in the human brain. He’s interested in the boundary between technology, open-source software, and scientific workflows, as well as creating new pathways for this kind of work in science and the academy. He’s a core member of Project Jupyter, specifically working with JupyterHub and Binder, two open-source projects that make it easier for researchers and educators to do their work in the cloud.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"http://basecampnetworks.com/\">Basecamp Networks</a> uses Machine Learning to diagnose easily what kind of sickness or parasite a crop might be suffering. They’re powered by Google Cloud Platform, and their CEO, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/craiganssle\">Craig Ganssle</a>, is here to tell <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/francesc\">Francesc</a> all about it.</p> <h5 id=\"about-craig-ganssle\">About Craig Ganssle</h5> <p>Craig Ganssle is the Founder and CEO of Basecamp Networks. With over 20 years in the technology industry, Craig has extensive experience developing and deploying wireless networks and designing predictive learning solutions for complex problem solving.</p> <p>Craig started Basecamp Networks in 2007 providing global wireless network infrastructures as well as creative solutions for difficult and time-consuming IT issues. As a partner with Google since 2008, Craig was one of the original Glass Explorers, Google’s original beta test group. In early 2013, Craig advanced to an elite small team for this innovative technology. Since then, under his leadership and Basecamp’s agricultural focus, Craig’s vision for Glass led his team to develop intelliSCOUT®, the world’s first wearable application offering farmers a truly hands-free solution, enabling agricultural problem-solving by collecting actionable insights from the field in a fraction of the time. intelliSCOUT® technology has been demonstrated, in conjunction with the Basecamp Networks’ offering, to dignitaries throughout the world, including France, where Craig was personally requested to present this technology to President Francois Hollande. In October 2016 Craig and Basecamp won the Atlanta Telecom Partnership (ATP) Technology Service Provider of The Year Award (in addition to his achievements in agricultural technological advancements).</p> <p>Prior to founding Basecamp Networks, Craig was recruited by Verizon Wireless in 2001 where he oversaw U.S. Southeast Operations in the network engineering division and was later tasked with deploying LTE in the Southeast United States.

They’re powered by Google Cloud Platform, and their CEO, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/craiganssle\">Craig Ganssle</a>, is here to tell <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/francesc\">Francesc</a> all about it.</p> About Craig Ganssle <p>Craig Ganssle is the Founder and CEO of Basecamp Networks. With over 20 years in the technology industry, Craig has extensive experience developing and deploying wireless networks and designing predictive learning solutions for complex problem solving.</p> <p>Craig started Basecamp Networks in 2007 providing global wireless network infrastructures as well as creative solutions for difficult and time-consuming IT issues. As a partner with Google since 2008, Craig was one of the original Glass Explorers, Google’s original beta test group. In early 2013, Craig advanced to an elite small team for this innovative technology. Since then, under his leadership and Basecamp’s agricultural focus, Craig’s vision for Glass led his team to develop intelliSCOUT®, the world’s first wearable application offering farmers a truly hands-free solution, enabling agricultural problem-solving by collecting actionable insights from the field in a fraction of the time. intelliSCOUT® technology has been demonstrated, in conjunction with the Basecamp Networks’ offering, to dignitaries throughout the world, including France, where Craig was personally requested to present this technology to President Francois Hollande. In October 2016 Craig and Basecamp won the Atlanta Telecom Partnership (ATP) Technology Service Provider of The Year Award (in addition to his achievements in agricultural technological advancements).</p> <p>Prior to founding Basecamp Networks, Craig was recruited by Verizon Wireless in 2001 where he oversaw U.S. Southeast Operations in the network engineering division and was later tasked with deploying LTE in the Southeast United States. Craig’s advanced innovative solutions are currently in use across Verizon’s entire company footprint today. During this time Craig also received a bachelor’s degree from Muhlenberg College in Business Administration, and a Computer Science degree from AIU.</p> <p>In addition to his contributions in the public sector, Craig served honorably in the United States Marine Corps as an intelligence communications operator with the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) 2nd Force Recon Battalion.
