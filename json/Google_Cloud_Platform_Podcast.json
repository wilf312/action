Responsible architects, Michael points out, continually evaluate their resources and patch, update, or remove as necessary to ensure proper security and optimize spending.

With the expansion of data use around the globe, data sovereignty has become more important as well, and Google Cloud products offer myriad tools to maintain control, privacy, and compliance no matter the location.

We learn what Key Access Justifications look like for users and how the encryption keys work in different Google Cloud services. Customer managed key material is stored outside of Google and the key manager must give permission for access for an added layer of trust and security. Seth and Bryce explain why this is important and describe how KAJ are used with some examples. These features may also be used to improve security in the future by preventing data from being decrypted and stolen should someone ever get access to your system.

As more and more data is taken into the cloud, countries are understandably concerned about a loss of control over this data, and nations are enacting laws and regulations to help manage security of data in the cloud. Standardization has been a human issue for a long time, from trains to international travel and more, Archana reminds us, and this challenge is now moving to the management of cloud data out in the world. As sovereign nations implement their own standards, cloud providers must adapt to help developers create projects that follow these laws.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Julien talks about the discussions around digital sovereignty in Europe, especially as it affects data security. Lawmakers, cloud providers, and companies have been working together to think through effective laws and strategies for digital security around the world. Googlers across the globe are working locally to make sure Google’s suite of products are compatible with government regulations and the needs of developers. Archana and Julien talk about the three important action segments Google employs to make sure tools allow for control over who has access to data when and how, and we hear the journey Google has trekked from the very beginning to now as the company has worked for strong security and versatile data management. Local partnerships are a big part of the advancements made in the sovereignty space, Julien tells us, increasing trust with developers in the area and leveraging local knowledge.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With offerings like Cloud Key Management, Google provides unique options for developers to control and secure data. To keep things easy, especially in the case of hybrid solutions, this portfolio of sovereignty products uses the same APIs, streamlined onboarding setups, and familiar interfaces Google product users are accustomed to.</span></p> <h5><strong>Archana Ramamoorthy</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Archana is the Director of Cloud Security Product Management.

We’re talking about all the exciting announcements, how the conference has changed in recent years, and what to expect in the days ahead.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The excitement and energy of the first in-person Next since 2019 was one of the best parts for Forrest. With 1300 releases in just half the year, a lot has happened in BigQuery, AI, Looker, and more. Next includes announcements in many of these areas as well, as Google Cloud expands and makes Cloud easier for all types of projects and clients. Strategic partnerships and development have allowed better use of Google Cloud for the virtual work world and advancements in sustainability have helped Google users feel better about their impact on the environment.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New announcements in compute include C3 VMs, the first VM in the cloud with 4th Gen Intel Xeon scalable processors with Google’s custom Intel IPU. MediaCDN uses the YouTube infrastructure and the new Live Stream API optimizes streaming capabilities. Among many other announcements, Network Analyzer is now GA allowing for simplified network configuration monitoring and Google Cloud Armor has been extended to include ML-based Adaptive Protection capabilities. Software Delivery Shield and Cloud Workstations are recent offerings to help developers in each of the four areas of software supply chain management. Advancements in Cloud Build include added security benefits, and new GKE and Cloud Run logging and security alerts ensure projects remain secure through the final stages of development.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to ensure secure, optimized work is with well-trained developers. And in that vein, Google Cloud is introducing Innovators Plus to provide a new suite of developer benefits under a fixed cost subscription. Forrest tells us about #GoogleClout and the challenges available in the Next portal for conference-goers. Assured Workloads helps with data sovereignty in different regions, Confidential Space in Confidential Computing provides trust guarantees when companies perform joint data analysis and machine learning training, and Chronicle Security Operations are some of the exciting security announcements we saw at Next.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the show next week, we’ll go in depth on data announcements at Next, but Steph gives us a quick rundown of some of the biggest ones today. She talks briefly about announcements in AI, including Vertex AI Vision and Translation Hub. Forrest wraps up by talking about predictions for the future of tech and cloud.</span></p> <h5><strong>Forrest Brazeal</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forrest Brazeal</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a cloud educator, author, speaker, and Pwnie Award-winning songwriter.

      "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the show this week, we’re talking updated DevOps practices for 2022 with hosts</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stephanie Wong</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ChloeCondon\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Chloe Condon</a> and our guests</span> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/nathenharvey\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathen Harvey</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Derek DeBellis.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathen and Derek start the show with a thorough discussion of DORA, the research program dedicated to helping organizations improve software delivery and operations, and the state of DevOps report that Google publishes every year. This year, the DevOps research team strengthened their focus on security and discovered that one of the biggest predictors in security practice adoption is company culture. Open, communicative, and trustful company cultures are some of the best for accepting and implementing optimized security practices. Derek tells us how company cultures are measured and scored for this purpose and Nathen talks about team and individual burnout and its affects on culture.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low, medium, high, and elite teams are another indicator of culture, and Nathen explains how teams earn their label through four keys of software delivery performance. Each year, they let the data show these four clusters of team performance. But this year there were only three, and Derek talks more about this phenomenon and why the elite cluster seems to have disappeared. When operational performance analysis was added, the four clusters reemerged and were renamed to better suit the new analysis metrics. Nathen details these four new clusters: starting, which performs neither well nor poorly and may be just starting out; flowing, teams that are performing well across throughput, stability, and operational performance; slowing teams, which don’t have high throughput but excel in other areas; and retiring teams, which are reliable but not actively developing projects. We discuss how companies may shift from one cluster to another and how much context can affect this shift.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We talk about key findings in the 2022 DevOps report, especially in the security space. Some of the most notable include the adoption of DevOps security practices and the decreased incidence of burnout on teams who leverage security practices. Nathen and Derek elaborate on how this year’s research changed from last year and what remained the same.</span></p> <h5><strong>Nathen Harvey</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nathenharvey\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathen</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">works with teams helping them learn about and apply the findings of our research into high performing teams. He’s been involved in the DevOps community for more than a decade.</span></p> <h5><strong>Derek DeBellis</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Derek is a Quantitative User Experience Researcher at Google, where Derek focuses on survey research, logs analysis, and figuring out ways to measure concepts central to product development. Derek has published on Human-AI interaction, the impact of Covid-19’s onset on smoking cessation, designing for NLP errors and the role of UX in ensuring privacy.</span></p> <h5><strong>Cool things of

      "content:encoded": "<p>On the show this week, we’re talking updated DevOps practices for 2022 with hosts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Stephanie Wong</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ChloeCondon\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Chloe Condon</a> and our guests <a href= \"https://twitter.com/nathenharvey\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Nathen Harvey</a> and Derek DeBellis.</p> <p>Nathen and Derek start the show with a thorough discussion of DORA, the research program dedicated to helping organizations improve software delivery and operations, and the state of DevOps report that Google publishes every year. This year, the DevOps research team strengthened their focus on security and discovered that one of the biggest predictors in security practice adoption is company culture. Open, communicative, and trustful company cultures are some of the best for accepting and implementing optimized security practices. Derek tells us how company cultures are measured and scored for this purpose and Nathen talks about team and individual burnout and its affects on culture.</p> <p>Low, medium, high, and elite teams are another indicator of culture, and Nathen explains how teams earn their label through four keys of software delivery performance. Each year, they let the data show these four clusters of team performance. But this year there were only three, and Derek talks more about this phenomenon and why the elite cluster seems to have disappeared. When operational performance analysis was added, the four clusters reemerged and were renamed to better suit the new analysis metrics. Nathen details these four new clusters: starting, which performs neither well nor poorly and may be just starting out; flowing, teams that are performing well across throughput, stability, and operational performance; slowing teams, which don’t have high throughput but excel in other areas; and retiring teams, which are reliable but not actively developing projects. We discuss how companies may shift from one cluster to another and how much context can affect this shift.</p> <p>We talk about key findings in the 2022 DevOps report, especially in the security space. Some of the most notable include the adoption of DevOps security practices and the decreased incidence of burnout on teams who leverage security practices. Nathen and Derek elaborate on how this year’s research changed from last year and what remained the same.</p> Nathen Harvey <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nathenharvey\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Nathen</a> works with teams helping them learn about and apply the findings of our research into high performing teams. He’s been involved in the DevOps community for more than a decade.</p> Derek DeBellis <p>Derek is a Quantitative User Experience Researcher at Google, where Derek focuses on survey research, logs analysis, and figuring out ways to measure concepts central to product development. Derek has published on Human-AI interaction, the impact of Covid-19’s onset on smoking cessation, designing for NLP errors and the role of UX in ensuring privacy.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Try out Cloud Spanner databases at no cost with new free trial instances <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/spanner/try-cloud-spanner-databases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Chipotle Is Testing More Artificial Intelligence Solutions To Improve Operations <a href= \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciakelso/2022/09/27/chipotle-is-testing-more-artificial-intelligence-solutions-to-improve-operations/?sh=25485e8851f9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Gyfted uses Google Cloud AI/ML tools to match tech workers with the best jobs <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/startups/how-gyfted-uses-google-cloud-aiml-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog</a></li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li class=\"WPT7ge\">2022 Accelerate State of DevOps Report <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/dora-2022-accelerate-state-of-devops-report-now-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">DevOps <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/devops\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">2022 State of the DevOps Report Report <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">DORA <a href= \"https://goto.google.com/dora-sodr-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">DORA Community <a href= \"https://sites.google.com/view/doracommunity\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">SLSA <a href=\"https://slsa.dev/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Security Software Development Framework <a href=\"https://goo.gle/ssdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Westrum organizational culture <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Google finds culture, not tech, is the biggest predictor of DevOps security outcomes <a href= \"https://siliconangle.com/2022/09/28/google-finds-culture-not-tech-biggest-predictor-devsec-outcomes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">GCP Podcast Episode 205: DevOps with Nathen Harvey and Jez Humble <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-205-devops-with-nathen-harvey-and-jez-humble/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">podcast</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">GCP Podcast Episode 284: State of DevOps Report 2021 with Nathen Harvey and Dustin Smith <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-284-state-of-devops-report-2021-with-nathen-harvey-and-dustin-smith/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">podcast</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">GCP Podcast Episode 290: Resiliency at Shopify with Camilo Lopez and Tai Dickerson <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-290-resiliency-at-shopify-with-camilo-lopez-and-tai-dickerson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">podcast</a></li> </ul> What’s something cool you’re working on? <p>Steph is working on talks for <a href=\"https://devfest.gdgnantes.com/en/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DevFest Nantes</a> and a Google Cloud dev conference in London.

It’s more than just including different types of people, Jason tells us, companies must also give them equal opportunities and say in their jobs. We talk about the difference between DEI and belonging. Belonging means feeling comfortable and accepted and conveys a more concrete, real-life sense of community that brings DEI to life. While DEI is easy enough for a company to measure, it’s sometimes tricky to get a clear picture of belonging in a company.

Vertex AI Experiments allows for easy, thorough ML experimentation and analysis of ML strategies.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our guests start the show with a brief introduction to Vertex AI and go on to help us understand where Experiments fits in. Because building ML models takes trial and error as we figure out what architecture and data management will work best, Experiments is a handy tool that helps developers try different variations. With extensive tracking capabilities and analysis tools, developers can see what is working, what’s not, and get ideas for other things to try. Ivan tells us about the two concepts to keep in mind before using Experiments: runs, which are training configurations, and experiments, adjustments you make as you look for the best solution.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vertex ML Metadata, a managed ML metadata tool, helps analyze Experiment runs in a graph, Ivan tells us. He takes us through an example ML model build and training using Vertex AI Experiments and other tools. He and Karthik also elaborate on the relationship between Vertex AI Experiments and Pipelines. We talk about the future of AI, including the foundational model, and some cool examples of what’s happening in the real world with Vertex AI Experiments.</span></p> <h5><strong>Ivan Nardini</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ilnardo92\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Ivan Nardini</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">is a customer engineer specialized in ML and passionate about Developer Advocacy and MLE.

Vertex AI Experiments allows for easy, thorough ML experimentation and analysis of ML strategies.</p> <p>Our guests start the show with a brief introduction to Vertex AI and go on to help us understand where Experiments fits in. Because building ML models takes trial and error as we figure out what architecture and data management will work best, Experiments is a handy tool that helps developers try different variations. With extensive tracking capabilities and analysis tools, developers can see what is working, what’s not, and get ideas for other things to try. Ivan tells us about the two concepts to keep in mind before using Experiments: runs, which are training configurations, and experiments, adjustments you make as you look for the best solution.</p> <p>Vertex ML Metadata, a managed ML metadata tool, helps analyze Experiment runs in a graph, Ivan tells us. He takes us through an example ML model build and training using Vertex AI Experiments and other tools. He and Karthik also elaborate on the relationship between Vertex AI Experiments and Pipelines. We talk about the future of AI, including the foundational model, and some cool examples of what’s happening in the real world with Vertex AI Experiments.</p> Ivan Nardini <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ilnardo92\">Ivan Nardini</a> is a customer engineer specialized in ML and passionate about Developer Advocacy and MLE.

Optimization is a huge theme this year, with a focus not only on cost optimization but also performance and resource use as well. Enterprise readiness and storage everywhere, Sean tells us, are the most important pillars as Google continues to improve offerings. We learn about Hyperdisk and the three customizable attributes users can control and the benefits of Filestore Enterprise for GKE for large client systems.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nishant talks about Cloud Storage and how clients are using it at scale for their huge data projects. Specifically, Google Storage has been working to help clients with large-scale data storage needs to optimize costs with Autoclass. Storage Insights is another new tool launching late this year or early next year that empowers better decision-making through increased knowledge and analytics of storage usage.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GKE storage is getting a revamp as well with Backup for GKE to help clients recover applications and data easily. Google Cloud for Backup and DR helps keep projects secure as well. This managed service is easy to use and integrate into all cloud projects and can be used with on prem projects and then backed up into the cloud. This is ideal for clients as they shift to cloud or hybrid systems. Companies like Redivis take advantage of some of these new data features, and Nishant talks more about how Autoclass and other tools have helped them save money and improve their business.</span></p> <h5><strong>Sean Derrington</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sean is the Group Product Manager for the storage team.

As a former educator, Laurie has seen the holes in tech education and, with the help of Google, is determined to aid faculty and students in expanding learning to include cloud education as well as the standard on prem curriculum. Aaron and Laurie work together toward this goal with programs like their Speaker Series.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laurie’s approach involves supporting faculty as they design courses that incorporate cloud technologies. With the busy lives of students today, she recognizes that the best way to get the information into the hands of students is through regular coursework, not just through elective activities outside the regular classroom.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aaron’s work with students and student organizations rounds out their support of higher education learning. He facilitates the creation of student clubs that use Cloud Skills Boost, a program in which students navigate full pathways as they learn the skills they need to create and manage cloud builds. Soon, Aaron will offer hack-a-thons that encourage students to attend weekend events to work together on passion projects outside of regular classwork.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our guests talk more about the specifics of Google Cloud Higher Education Programs and the importance of incorporating certifications into the higher education learning process. Aaron talks about expanding the program and his hopes for reaching out to more schools and students and Laurie talks about the funding for students and how Google Cloud’s system of credits for students enables them to use real cloud tools without a credit card. Laurie and Aaron tell us fun stories about past student successes, conference interactions, and hack-a-thon projects that went well.</span></p> <h5><strong>Laurie White</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laurie taught CS in higher ed for over 30 years where her biggest frustration was trying to keep the curriculum up with the field. She thought she was retiring seven years ago but got the call from Google to a job where she could help faculty around the world keep their curriculum up with cloud computing, so here she is.</span></p> <h5><strong>Aaron Yeats</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aaron Yeats has been working in education outreach for two decades.

Google’s managed service, Vertex Explainable AI, offers Feature Attribution and Example Based Explanations to provide better understanding of model decision making. Irina describes these two services and how each works to foster better decision-making based on AI models. One or both services can be used in every stage of model building and to create a more precise model with better results.

Presets provide easier setup and use as well. We talk more about the benefits of being able to easily explain your models. When decision-makers understand the importance of your AI tool, it’s more likely to be cleared for production, for example. When you understand why your model is making certain choices, you can trust the model’s outcomes as part of your decision-making process.</span></p> <h5><strong>Irina Sigler</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irina Sigler is a Product Manager on the Vertex Explainable AI team.

We’re talking about Prometheus with guests</span> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/leeyanco\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lee Yanco</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ashidhull\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Ashish Kumar</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">and learning about the build process for Google Cloud’s Managed Service for Prometheus and how Home Depot uses this tool to power their business.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin with, Lee helps us understand what Managed Service for Prometheus is. Prometheus, a popular monitoring solution for Kubernetes, lets you know that your project is up and running and in the event of a failure, Prometheus lets you know what happened. But as Kubernetes projects scale and spread across the globe, Prometheus becomes a challenge to manage, and that’s where Google Cloud’s Managed Service for Prometheus comes in. Lee describes why Prometheus is so great for Kubernetes, and Ashish talks about CNCF’s involvement helps open source tools integrate easily. With the help of Monarch, Google’s Managed Service stands above the competition, and Lee explains what Monarch is and how it works with Prometheus to benefit users.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashish talks about Home Depot’s use of Google Cloud and the Managed Service for Prometheus, and how Home Depot’s multiple data centers make data monitoring both trickier and more important. With Google Cloud, Home Depot is able to easily ensure everything is healthy and running across data centers, around the world, at an immense scale.

      "content:encoded": "<p>Hosts <a href= \"https://twitter.com/carterthecomic\">Carter Morgan</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/agmsbusho\">Anthony Bushong</a> are in the studio this week! We’re talking about Prometheus with guests <a href= \"https://twitter.com/leeyanco\">Lee Yanco</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ashidhull\">Ashish Kumar</a> and learning about the build process for Google Cloud’s Managed Service for Prometheus and how Home Depot uses this tool to power their business.</p> <p>To begin with, Lee helps us understand what Managed Service for Prometheus is. Prometheus, a popular monitoring solution for Kubernetes, lets you know that your project is up and running and in the event of a failure, Prometheus lets you know what happened. But as Kubernetes projects scale and spread across the globe, Prometheus becomes a challenge to manage, and that’s where Google Cloud’s Managed Service for Prometheus comes in. Lee describes why Prometheus is so great for Kubernetes, and Ashish talks about CNCF’s involvement helps open source tools integrate easily. With the help of Monarch, Google’s Managed Service stands above the competition, and Lee explains what Monarch is and how it works with Prometheus to benefit users.</p> <p>Ashish talks about Home Depot’s use of Google Cloud and the Managed Service for Prometheus, and how Home Depot’s multiple data centers make data monitoring both trickier and more important. With Google Cloud, Home Depot is able to easily ensure everything is healthy and running across data centers, around the world, at an immense scale. He describes how Home Depot uses Managed Service for Prometheus in each of these data center environments from the point of view of a developer and talks about how easy Prometheus and the Managed Service are to integrate and use.</p> <p>Lee and Ashish wrap up the show with a look at how Home Depot and Google have worked together to create and adjust tools for increased efficiency.

Veeam is revolutionizing the data space by minimizing data loss impacts and project downtime with easy backups and user-friendly disaster recovery solutions.</p> <p>As a software company, Veeam is able to stay flexible with its solutions, helping customers keep any project safe. Cody explains what is meant by disaster recovery and how different systems might require different levels of fail-safe protection. Jo-Anne talks about the financial cost of downtime and how Veeam can help save money by planning for and preventing downtime. Veeam backup and replication is the main offering that can be customized depending on workloads, Cody tells us. He gives examples of how this works for different types of projects. Businesses can easily make plans for recovery and data backups then implement them with the help of Veeam. Cody talks about cloud migration and how Veeam can streamline this process with its replication services, and Jo-Anne emphasizes the importance of these recovery processes for data in the cloud.</p> <p>The journey from fledgling Veeam to their current suite of offerings was an interesting one, and Cody talks about this evolution, starting with the simple VM backups of version 5. As companies have brought new recovery challenges, Veeam has grown to provide these services. Their partnership with Google has grown as well, as they continue to leverage Google offerings and support Google Cloud customers. We hear examples of Veeam customers and how they use the software, and Cody tells us a little about the future of Veeam.</p> Cody Ault <p>Cody has been at Veeam for over 11 years in various roles and departments including Technical Lead for US Support team, Advisory Architect for Presales Solutions Architect and Staff Solutions Architect for Product Management Alliances. He has acted as the performance, databases, security, and monitoring specialist for North America for the Presales team and has helped develop the Veeam Design Methodology and Architecture Documentation template.

What kind of computing power does it take to break the world record for pi computations? Emma and Sara are here to tell us.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emma tells us how she started with pi and how she and Sara came to work together to break the record. In 2019, Emma was on the show with her previous world record, and with the advancements in technology and Google products since, she knew she could do even more this year. Her 100 trillion digit goal wasn’t enough to scare people away, and Sara, along with other partners, joined Emma on the pi computation journey. Together, Sara and Emma talk about the hardware required, building the algorithm, how it’s run, and where the data is stored. Running on a personal computer was cheaper and easier than a super computer, and Emma explains why. Performing these immense calculations can also help illustrate just how far computers have come.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The storage required for this project was immense, and Emma tells us how they worked around some of the storage limitations. We hear more about Ycruncher and how it was used to help with calculations. Our guests talk about how things might change for computing and specifically for pi computations in the next few years, and Sara tells us about the storage journey from the perspective of a mathematician, and gives us some interesting facts about the algorithms involved, and we learn how world records are verified.</span></p> <h5><strong>Emma Haruka Iwao</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yuryu\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Emma</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">is a developer advocate for Google Cloud Platform, focusing on application developers’ experience and high performance computing.

What kind of computing power does it take to break the world record for pi computations? Emma and Sara are here to tell us.</p> <p>Emma tells us how she started with pi and how she and Sara came to work together to break the record. In 2019, Emma was on the show with her previous world record, and with the advancements in technology and Google products since, she knew she could do even more this year. Her 100 trillion digit goal wasn’t enough to scare people away, and Sara, along with other partners, joined Emma on the pi computation journey. Together, Sara and Emma talk about the hardware required, building the algorithm, how it’s run, and where the data is stored. Running on a personal computer was cheaper and easier than a super computer, and Emma explains why. Performing these immense calculations can also help illustrate just how far computers have come.</p> <p>The storage required for this project was immense, and Emma tells us how they worked around some of the storage limitations. We hear more about Ycruncher and how it was used to help with calculations. Our guests talk about how things might change for computing and specifically for pi computations in the next few years, and Sara tells us about the storage journey from the perspective of a mathematician, and gives us some interesting facts about the algorithms involved, and we learn how world records are verified.</p> Emma Haruka Iwao <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yuryu\">Emma</a> is a developer advocate for Google Cloud Platform, focusing on application developers’ experience and high performance computing. She has been a C++ developer for 15 years and worked on embedded systems and the Chromium Project. Emma is passionate about learning and explaining the most fundamental technologies such as operating systems, distributed systems, and internet protocols. Besides software engineering, she likes games, traveling, and eating delicious food.</p> Sara Ford <p>Sara Ford is a Developer Advocate on Google Cloud focusing on Serverless.

He describes FinOps as financial DevOps, making financial decisions in an effective and optimized way. With his experience in finance and tax accounting, Joe has developed a special knack for navigating the sometimes confusing world of cloud finance policies, and his contributions to the FinOps Foundation have been many.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, collaboration with various business departments is important for developing a plan that leverages the benefits of the cloud but keeps the company using resources wisely, Joe explains. He talks about the FinOps Foundation and their focus on creating community for knowledge sharing.

The three steps, Joe tells us, are inform, optimize, and operate. The inform phase involves clarity in spending so teams understand how much money is being spent. In the optimize phase, benefits of spending are matched with expenditures to ensure resources are being used to their full potential. Finally, in the operate phase, engineers and finance managers come together to understand why solutions were chosen and understand if these tools are offering the right answers for the company.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every company is different but the sooner it’s possible to start the FinOps journey the easier it will be to maintain in the future. Joe gives us examples of how companies are using the principles for successful strategies and the challenges that some of them have faced.

Manasa tells us about the four modules of Network Intelligence Center and how they work together.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of Network Intelligence Center, the new Network Analyzer monitors and proactively runs tests and detects issues on the network automatically, taking the guesswork out of network troubleshooting. Network Analyzer checks the entire network ecosystem, finding any connectivity issues and extrapolating them to other similar situations as well. Zach tells us more about the specific features of Analyzer, like its ability to check for overlapping or shadowed routes and validating network configurations in relation to any managed services being used.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zach walks us through the set up of Network Analyzer and how to navigate results.

Google Cloud’s Network Intelligence Center is described as a one-stop shop that simplifies network monitoring, troubleshooting, workload expansion, security, and more. Manasa tells us about the four modules of Network Intelligence Center and how they work together.</p> <p>As part of Network Intelligence Center, the new Network Analyzer monitors and proactively runs tests and detects issues on the network automatically, taking the guesswork out of network troubleshooting. Network Analyzer checks the entire network ecosystem, finding any connectivity issues and extrapolating them to other similar situations as well. Zach tells us more about the specific features of Analyzer, like its ability to check for overlapping or shadowed routes and validating network configurations in relation to any managed services being used.</p> <p>Zach walks us through the set up of Network Analyzer and how to navigate results. Manasa expands on the development of Network Analyzer, including how customer feedback really shaped the project, and we hear about challenges along the way.

Both are managed for the customer in GKE. The new addition of release channels allows flexibility with release updating so customers can adjust to their specific project needs. Each channel offers a different updating mix and speed, and clients choose the channel that’s right for their project. The idea for release channels isn’t a new one, Kobi explains. In fact, Google’s frequent project releases, while keeping things secure and running well, also can be customized by choosing from an assortment of channels in other Google offerings like Chrome.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our guests talk us through the process of releasing through channels and how each release marinates in the Rapid channel to be sure the version is supported and secure before being pushed to customers through other channels.

This fully managed, Postgres compatible database for enterprise use combines the power of Google Cloud and the best features of Postgres for superior data management.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AlloyDB began years ago as a solution to help manage huge data migrations to the cloud. Customers needed a way to take advantage of the benefits of cloud, modernizing their databases as they migrated in an easy, flexible, and scalable way. Databases had to maintain performance and availability while offering enterprise customers optimal security features and more. We learn why PostgreSQL is important in the equation and how AlloyDB is built with Google scaling abilities and ML while supporting open source compatibility.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We talk about data analytics workloads and how AlloyDB handles in-the-moment analytics needs. Our guests describe and compare different database offerings at Google, emphasizing the solutions that set AlloyDB apart. We chat about the types of projects each database is best suited for and how AlloyDB fits into the Google database portfolio. We hear examples of customers moving to AlloyDB and how they’re using this new service.

This fully managed, Postgres compatible database for enterprise use combines the power of Google Cloud and the best features of Postgres for superior data management.</p> <p>AlloyDB began years ago as a solution to help manage huge data migrations to the cloud. Customers needed a way to take advantage of the benefits of cloud, modernizing their databases as they migrated in an easy, flexible, and scalable way. Databases had to maintain performance and availability while offering enterprise customers optimal security features and more. We learn why PostgreSQL is important in the equation and how AlloyDB is built with Google scaling abilities and ML while supporting open source compatibility.</p> <p>We talk about data analytics workloads and how AlloyDB handles in-the-moment analytics needs. Our guests describe and compare different database offerings at Google, emphasizing the solutions that set AlloyDB apart. We chat about the types of projects each database is best suited for and how AlloyDB fits into the Google database portfolio. We hear examples of customers moving to AlloyDB and how they’re using this new service.

With better data, easier access, and substantially more cloud compute power, companies are awakening to the possibilities of geospatial driven projects that analyze not just text but photographic data as well. Thousands of satellites collect information about Earth every day, and companies are realizing just how much of this data is available for their own sustainability, geo-centric, and location-based projects. Geospatial, Nathan explains, can help combine layers of text and photo data based on one location for a richer, more robust view of a particular location in real time.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a geospatial partner with Google for a decade, NGIS has had experience using Earth Engine, Google Maps, and more to help Google Cloud customers use this data in meaningful ways. Because most projects involve analyzing locations as they change over time, companies need massive storage and processing power for their data. This is only made possible with the recent advances in infrastructure afforded by the cloud. With these amazing advances in technology, Denise and Nathan are seeing more and more exciting use cases. Companies are taking this data and making meaningful decisions for their future and the future of the planet. Sustainability goals like limiting deforestation in the supply chain can be made and measured. Climate change models can be created and applied. And all of this can be done quickly.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan and Denise talk about TraceMark, the sustainable sourcing solution built by NGIS and made to integrate flexibly with customer projects. Consumers are increasingly aware of their affect on the environment and are pushing for change. With TraceMark, companies are able to see the environmental impact of their supply chain partners and make changes in line with customer values. These decisions can influence the growth of the company as well, as suppliers are vetted and chosen based on sustainability and availability. We hear about the building of TraceMark and the challenges the team overcame. Denise runs through some features of the software and how users can take advantage of them. Our guests give some great tips for organizations to get started with their data-driven sustainability goals, and Nathan talks about what’s next with NGIS and TraceMark.</span></p> <h5><strong>Nathan Eaton</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Executive Director at NGIS, Nathan has worked with hundreds of clients to deliver fit for purpose, innovative solutions. Nathan leads our GIS capabilities and stakeholder management including consulting with a range of large multinational companies and federal government departments. Most recently, Nathan has led the development, build and launch of TraceMark, a SaaS sustainable sourcing solution from NGIS, Google Cloud and partners Planet and CARTO.</span></p> <h5><strong>Denise Pearl</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DPearl_Reframe\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Denise Pearl</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">leads strategic ISV efforts for Google Cloud’s Geospatial, Earth Observation and Sustainability vertical.

      "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, we’re busting myths around Cloud Spanner with our guests Pritam Shah and Vaibhav Govil.</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Mirchandani</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">and</span> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/maxsaltonstall\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Max Saltonstall</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">host this episode and learn about the fantastic capabilities of Cloud Spanner. Our guests give us a quick run-down of Spanner database software and its fully-managed offerings.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spanner’s unique take on the relational database has sparked some myths. We start by addressing cost and the idea that Spanner is expensive. With its high availability achieved through synchronously replicating data, failures are virtually a non-issue, making the cost well worth it. Our guests describe other features that add to the value of Spanner as well. Workloads of any size are a good fit for Spanner because of its scalability and pricing based on use.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite rumors, Spanner is now very easy to start using. New additions like the PostgreSQL interface and ORM support have made the usability of Spanner much more familiar. Regional and multi-regional instances are supported, busting the myth that Spanner is only good for global workloads. Our guests offer examples of projects using local and global configurations with Spanner.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the database world, Vaibhav sees trends like the convergence of non-relational and relational databases as well as convergence in the OLTP and OLAP database semantics, and he tells us how Spanner is adapting and growing with these trends. Pritam points out that customers are paying more attention to total cost of ownership, the importance of scalable and reliable database solutions, and the peace of mind that comes with a managed database system. Spanner helps customers with these, freeing up business resources for other things.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Spanner has made many announcements about new capabilities coming soon, like PostgreSQL interface on spanner GA, Query Insights visualization tools, cross-regional backups GA, and more. We hear all about these awesome updates.</span></p> <h5><strong>Pritam Shah</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pritam is the Director of Engineering for Cloud Spanner. He has been with Google for about four and a half years. Before Spanner, he was the Engineering Lead for observability libraries at Google. That included Distributed Tracing and Metrics at Google scale. His mission was to democratize the instrumentation libraries. That is when he launched Open Census and then took on Cloud Spanner.</span></p> <h5><strong>Vaibhav Govil</strong></h5> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaibhav is the Product lead for Spanner. He has been in this role for the past three years, and before this he was a Product Manager in Google Cloud Storage in Google. Overall, he has spent close to four years at Google, and it has been a great experience.</span></p> <h5><strong>Cool things of the week</strong></h5> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"

      "content:encoded": "<p>This week, we’re busting myths around Cloud Spanner with our guests Pritam Shah and Vaibhav Govil. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/maxsaltonstall\">Max Saltonstall</a> host this episode and learn about the fantastic capabilities of Cloud Spanner. Our guests give us a quick run-down of Spanner database software and its fully-managed offerings.</p> <p>Spanner’s unique take on the relational database has sparked some myths. We start by addressing cost and the idea that Spanner is expensive. With its high availability achieved through synchronously replicating data, failures are virtually a non-issue, making the cost well worth it. Our guests describe other features that add to the value of Spanner as well. Workloads of any size are a good fit for Spanner because of its scalability and pricing based on use.</p> <p>Despite rumors, Spanner is now very easy to start using. New additions like the PostgreSQL interface and ORM support have made the usability of Spanner much more familiar. Regional and multi-regional instances are supported, busting the myth that Spanner is only good for global workloads. Our guests offer examples of projects using local and global configurations with Spanner.</p> <p>In the database world, Vaibhav sees trends like the convergence of non-relational and relational databases as well as convergence in the OLTP and OLAP database semantics, and he tells us how Spanner is adapting and growing with these trends. Pritam points out that customers are paying more attention to total cost of ownership, the importance of scalable and reliable database solutions, and the peace of mind that comes with a managed database system. Spanner helps customers with these, freeing up business resources for other things.</p> <p>This year, Spanner has made many announcements about new capabilities coming soon, like PostgreSQL interface on spanner GA, Query Insights visualization tools, cross-regional backups GA, and more. We hear all about these awesome updates.</p> Pritam Shah <p>Pritam is the Director of Engineering for Cloud Spanner. He has been with Google for about four and a half years. Before Spanner, he was the Engineering Lead for observability libraries at Google. That included Distributed Tracing and Metrics at Google scale. His mission was to democratize the instrumentation libraries. That is when he launched Open Census and then took on Cloud Spanner.</p> Vaibhav Govil <p>Vaibhav is the Product lead for Spanner. He has been in this role for the past three years, and before this he was a Product Manager in Google Cloud Storage in Google. Overall, he has spent close to four years at Google, and it has been a great experience.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Our plans to invest $9.5 billion in the U.S. in 2022 <a href= \"https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/investing-america-2022/\"> blog</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">A policy roadmap for 24⁄7 carbon-free energy <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/a-policy-roadmap-for-achieving-247-carbon-free-energy\"> blog</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">SRE Prodcast <a href= \"https://sre.google/prodcast/\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Meet the people of Google Cloud: Grace Mollison, solutions architect and professional problem solver <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/meet-the-people-of-google-cloud-grace-mollison\"> blog</a> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\">GCP Podcast Episode 224: Solutions Engineering with Grace Mollison and Ann Wallace <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-224-solutions-engineering-with-grace-mollison-and-ann-wallace/\"> podcast</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Spanner <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/spanner\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud Spanner myths busted <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/cloud-spanner-myths-busted\"> blog</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">PostgreSQL interface <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/postgresql-interface\"> docs</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud Spanner Ecosystem <a href= \"https://www.cloudspannerecosystem.dev/\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Spanner: Google’s Globally-Distributed Database <a href= \"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf\"> white paper</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Spanner Docs <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/tutorials\">docs</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Spanner Qwiklabs <a href= \"https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1774?parent=catalog\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Using the Cloud Spanner Emulator <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/emulator\"> docs</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">GCP Podcast Episode 62: Cloud Spanner with Deepti Srivastava <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-62-cloud-spanner-with-deepti-srivastava/\"> podcast</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">GCP Podcast Episode 248: Cloud Spanner Revisited with Dilraj Kaur and Christoph Bussler <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-248-cloud-spanner-revisited-with-dilraj-kaur-and-christoph-bussler/\"> podcast</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud Spanner federated queries <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/cloud-spanner-federated-queries\"> docs</a></li> </ul> What’s something cool you’re working on? <p>Max is working on a new podcast platform and some spring break projects.</p> Hosts <p>Mark Mirchandani and Max Saltonstall</p>",

The unique batch and stream method and emphasis on correctness garnered support from developers early on and continues to attract users. Pablo helps us understand why Beam is a better option for certain projects looking to process large amounts of data. Our guests describe how Beam may be a better fit than microservices that could become obsolete as company needs change.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, we step back and take a look at why batch and stream is the gold standard of data processing because of its balance between low latency and ease of “being done” with data collection. Beam’s focus on the correctness of data and correctness in processing that data is a core component. With good data, processing becomes easier, more reliable, and cheaper. Kenn gives examples of how things can go wrong with bad data processing. Beam strives for the perfect combination of low latency, correct data, and affordability. Users can choose where to run Beam pipelines, from other Apache software offerings to Dataflow, which means excellent flexibility. Our guests talk about the pros and cons of some of these options and we hear examples of how companies are using Beam along with supporting software to solve data processing challenges.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get started with Beam, check out Beam College or attend Beam Summit 2022.</span></p> <h5><strong>Kenneth Knowles</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KennKnowles\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Kenn Knowles</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">is chair of the Apache Beam Project Management Committee.

The unique batch and stream method and emphasis on correctness garnered support from developers early on and continues to attract users. Pablo helps us understand why Beam is a better option for certain projects looking to process large amounts of data. Our guests describe how Beam may be a better fit than microservices that could become obsolete as company needs change.</p> <p>Next, we step back and take a look at why batch and stream is the gold standard of data processing because of its balance between low latency and ease of “being done” with data collection. Beam’s focus on the correctness of data and correctness in processing that data is a core component. With good data, processing becomes easier, more reliable, and cheaper. Kenn gives examples of how things can go wrong with bad data processing. Beam strives for the perfect combination of low latency, correct data, and affordability.

SQL Commenter helps database observability in two ways: it is both a library and a standard, Nimesh tells us. He describes the process for us, detailing exactly how SQL Commenter effects projects.

Backend data like metrics from Cloud Monitoring and client libraries can be correlated together with SQL Commenter and brought into Splunk for full stack observability. Nimesh offers client examples to help us understand how these useful tools integrate for optimal observability. He tells us about the databases and ORMs supported by SQL Commenter.

Building diversity, equity, and inclusion into companies is important for success, and our last segment offers advice on how to incorporate DEI initiatives to ensure employees feel valued.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Build a data mesh on Google Cloud with Dataplex, now generally available <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/build-a-data-mesh-on-google-cloud-with-dataplex-now-generally-available\"> blog</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">From watersheds to Koala habitats - tackling ecosystem restoration with data <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/how-restor-is-using-google-earth-engine-data-to-tackle-ecosystem-restoration\"> blog</a></li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Understanding Cloud SQL Maintenance: why is it needed? <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/how-does-cloud-sql-maintenance-work\"> blog</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Cloud SQL <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/sql\">site</a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Faster, cheaper, greener?

He details their data storage and analytics structure, describing it as a reverse pyramid of tons of data with few engineers to manage and analyze it. To handle this, Postmates takes a stay-out-of-the-way approach by providing good data and letting the analysts do what they do best without micromanaging. Aaron talks about this data architecture, including the use of BigQuery as data lakes to keep data storage simple, and how Google collaboration tools streamline access and authorization tasks. Communication and flexibility are important, Aaron tells us, and he offers other advice for companies designing data systems. Feedback loops, dedicated training, and an open environment with no silos also help foster a productive, healthy data workplace.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matteo of Delivery Hero speaks to Bruno next. With the goal of increasing their global reach and offerings, it’s important that Delivery Hero has a smooth data system. Matteo outlines the new data structure they’ve built to ease onboarding of new companies and territories and describes different use cases for their data. From determining the number of delivery people necessary in each area to offering personalized customer recommendations, Delivery Hero uses Google offerings like Google Analytics and BigQuery to interpret collected data. Matteo details how they tailor data infrastructures for each use case and offers tips to help companies think through their data infrastructure design. Don’t work in a bubble, Matteo stresses, and focus on thorough onboarding of team members and clear communication with colleagues and customers.</span></p> <h5><strong>Bruno Aziza</strong></h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brunoaziza\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Bruno</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">is the Head of Data & Analytics at Google Cloud.

He details their data storage and analytics structure, describing it as a reverse pyramid of tons of data with few engineers to manage and analyze it. To handle this, Postmates takes a stay-out-of-the-way approach by providing good data and letting the analysts do what they do best without micromanaging. Aaron talks about this data architecture, including the use of BigQuery as data lakes to keep data storage simple, and how Google collaboration tools streamline access and authorization tasks. Communication and flexibility are important, Aaron tells us, and he offers other advice for companies designing data systems. Feedback loops, dedicated training, and an open environment with no silos also help foster a productive, healthy data workplace.</p> <p>Matteo of Delivery Hero speaks to Bruno next. With the goal of increasing their global reach and offerings, it’s important that Delivery Hero has a smooth data system. Matteo outlines the new data structure they’ve built to ease onboarding of new companies and territories and describes different use cases for their data. From determining the number of delivery people necessary in each area to offering personalized customer recommendations, Delivery Hero uses Google offerings like Google Analytics and BigQuery to interpret collected data. Matteo details how they tailor data infrastructures for each use case and offers tips to help companies think through their data infrastructure design. Don’t work in a bubble, Matteo stresses, and focus on thorough onboarding of team members and clear communication with colleagues and customers.</p> Bruno Aziza <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brunoaziza\">Bruno</a> is the Head of Data & Analytics at Google Cloud.

Together, these tools make the three pillars of geospatial cloud: analysis of vector data with tools like CloudSQL or BigQuery, analysis of image data with Earth Engine, and taking advantage of the data assets. This geospatial analysis helps us understand the world and how it’s changing, then apply this information to make important, environmentally friendly decisions.</p> <p>As a key part of this system, Earth Engine is a geospatial data-processing platform specializing in the analysis of satellite images and other image data. It provides access to over 800 datasets and processing software that scales to planetary-scale analysis. At Next, Google announced Earth Engine availability for commercial use. Our guests talk about the applications of this in the real world, from the effect of climate risk on a financial portfolio to locations most susceptible to forest fire.</p> <p>Chad and Joel tell us about the sources of Earth Engine’s data, the pre-processing work done to the images collected, and the ease of data sharing between platforms. By working with BigQuery, users have access to additional datasets and analytics tools as well. Google clients are taking this data and creatively using the information to make meaningful decisions. Insurance companies, for example, analyze data to assess flood risk, while the U.S. Forest Service uses the platform to advance their mission of sustainable forest management. Unilever uses Earth Engine in their commitment to zero additional deforestation in their supply chain, and our guests talk more about the Next presentation with Unilever. Additional BigQuery announcements at Next can be leveraged in Earth Engine as well, and new features such as Analytics Hub make accessing datasets even easier.</p> <p>Google works to meet users where they are and make tools easy to use from day one.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> is back this week with cohost Bukola Ayodele. We’re talking with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">Eric Schmidt</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brunoaziza\">Bruno Aziza</a> about all the awesome new analytics, data, and AI launches from last week’s Google Cloud Next conference.</p> <p>Our guests start the show outlining the challenges clients face when storing, organizing, and analyzing data in the cloud. These needs have inspired Google solutions that focus on simplifying data management for customers. Next announcements like BigQuery Omni, which helps customers achieve full data visibility with cross-cloud analytics, and DataPlex, which facilitates data management at scale, will change the way companies think about their data. BigQuery integration with AppSheets and the new Cloud Looker LookML let customers build once and access from anywhere. The new Looker and Tableau integration revolutionizes the use of the semantic model in Tableau, allowing things like company-established data governance and the Looker Blocks ecosystem to pull into Tableau analysis. New Looker Blocks specifically targeted to the healthcare industry were also introduced at Next.</p> <p>We talk about the ML announcements including Vertex AI Workbench, a fully-managed service used for data exploration aimed at simplifying the workloads of data engineers. Serverless Spark on Google Cloud shares these goals by making performance tuning, scaling, infrastructure provisioning, and other tasks fully-managed. The new PostgreSQL interface for Spanner lets clients use tools already developed in PostgreSQL while leveraging the global scaling and other benefits of Spanner.</p> <p>Bruno and Eric share some favorite customer stories as we wrap up this week’s episode. Albertson’s, Renault, and others have interesting data journeys on Google Cloud and our listeners can learn more in the YouTube series hosted by Bruno.</p> <h5 id=\"eric-schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</h5> <p>Eric is the the Head of Advocacy for Data Analytics at Google and has been at Google for almost eight years. Previously, he was with Microsoft, where he led Advocacy and Evangelism there, too. He focuses on products like BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc and leads a team of advocates who help customers turn data into value. In his downtime, Eric is a DJ at 90.3 KEXP here in Seattle or online at <a href=\"https://kexp.org\">kexp.org</a> where he focuses on global music culture.</p> <p>You can find Eric on <a href= \"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">Twitter</a>. His handle is “not that eric” - not to be confused with the ‘other Eric Schmidt’ here at Google. In fact, internally, people affectionately call him “cloud E”.</p> <h5 id=\"bruno-aziza\">Bruno Aziza</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brunoaziza\">Bruno</a> is the Head of Data & Analytics at Google Cloud. He specializes in everything data, from data analytics, to business intelligence, data science, and artificial intelligence.

      "content:encoded": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> is back this week with cohost Bukola Ayodele. We’re talking with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">Eric Schmidt</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brunoaziza\">Bruno Aziza</a> about all the awesome new analytics, data, and AI launches from last week’s Google Cloud Next conference.</p> <p>Our guests start the show outlining the challenges clients face when storing, organizing, and analyzing data in the cloud. These needs have inspired Google solutions that focus on simplifying data management for customers. Next announcements like BigQuery Omni, which helps customers achieve full data visibility with cross-cloud analytics, and DataPlex, which facilitates data management at scale, will change the way companies think about their data. BigQuery integration with AppSheets and the new Cloud Looker LookML let customers build once and access from anywhere. The new Looker and Tableau integration revolutionizes the use of the semantic model in Tableau, allowing things like company-established data governance and the Looker Blocks ecosystem to pull into Tableau analysis. New Looker Blocks specifically targeted to the healthcare industry were also introduced at Next.</p> <p>We talk about the ML announcements including Vertex AI Workbench, a fully-managed service used for data exploration aimed at simplifying the workloads of data engineers. Serverless Spark on Google Cloud shares these goals by making performance tuning, scaling, infrastructure provisioning, and other tasks fully-managed. The new PostgreSQL interface for Spanner lets clients use tools already developed in PostgreSQL while leveraging the global scaling and other benefits of Spanner.</p> <p>Bruno and Eric share some favorite customer stories as we wrap up this week’s episode. Albertson’s, Renault, and others have interesting data journeys on Google Cloud and our listeners can learn more in the YouTube series hosted by Bruno.</p> Eric Schmidt <p>Eric is the the Head of Advocacy for Data Analytics at Google and has been at Google for almost eight years. Previously, he was with Microsoft, where he led Advocacy and Evangelism there, too. He focuses on products like BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc and leads a team of advocates who help customers turn data into value. In his downtime, Eric is a DJ at 90.3 KEXP here in Seattle or online at <a href=\"https://kexp.org\">kexp.org</a> where he focuses on global music culture.</p> <p>You can find Eric on <a href= \"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">Twitter</a>. His handle is “not that eric” - not to be confused with the ‘other Eric Schmidt’ here at Google. In fact, internally, people affectionately call him “cloud E”.</p> Bruno Aziza <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brunoaziza\">Bruno</a> is the Head of Data & Analytics at Google Cloud. He specializes in everything data, from data analytics, to business intelligence, data science, and artificial intelligence.

Baseball teams are independently owned franchises, Perry explains, with MLB acting as the oversight corporation. This keeps game play fair and consistent. Like most large corporations these days, technology has become a vital business tool for MLB. Their partnership with Google facilitated a shift from on-prem to the cloud, allowing MLB to take advantage of advanced capabilities like scaling and managed services in a safe environment. JoAnn talks about the process of this shift and the teams at Google that helped make it happen. She details the systems that MLB has moved to GCP, like game scheduling, umpire management, backend systems, and especially the draft.</p> <p>The amateur draft, a multi-day event, has a special set of challenges that MLB and Google had to overcome. Analyzing player statistics and updating which players have been picked and who is still available are important information for teams. These stats must update quickly and accurately. On the backend, the Electronic Baseball Information System (EBIS) is the MLB software making this all happen, and JoAnn helps us understand the technical side of this Kubernetes-built platform. Google monitoring and EBIS-specific tools keep the draft running smoothly. Our guests take us through this list of tools employed and why they were chosen.</p> <p>We hear more about the process of moving such a complicated system to the cloud and what MLB did to make the shift easier. Perry and JoAnn talk about the testing done before draft days to ensure a smooth experience for all and important lessons they learned. To wrap up the show, our guests offer advice, stressing the importance of observability and starting small.

Our guests <a href= \"https://twitter.com/frwck\">Matthias Farwick</a> of Txture, Patrick Niesel of Accenture, and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/jpurvor\">Jason Purvor</a> of Google help us understand their roles in cloud migration with some formal introductions to start the show.</p> <p>Txture helps companies assess their migration capabilities, providing insights to what will be necessary in the process and how viable cloud migration is as an option. Accenture works with Txture to augment the planning of migration strategies for clients. Jason helps us understand how Google uses the information gleaned from these assessments to help customers understand what the journey to Google Cloud will look like for their business. Txture provides good data which helps Google and clients make better decisions, not just in migration, but for the future health of the project while operating in the cloud.</p> <p>Our guests share the challenges of cloud migration and detail how these three powerhouse companies work together to overcome hurdles. From information gathering and budgeting to security and implementation, Txture, Accenture, and Google help companies understand their specific obstacles and develop a plan. Matthias uses a large banking client as an example to walk our listeners through a typical cloud migration process that takes advantage of Txture, Accenture, and Google.</p> <p>Jason details the process customers go through with Google as they establish their cloud environments and make decisions about the future of their projects. Through the analysis of four layers, Google helps customers think through this highly technical and involved migration process. Matthias describes the three assessment steps Txture applies to the process as well, and how these multiple-company analyses work together to create a solid cloud project now and continue to improve the project in the future.</p> <p>Matthias, Patrick, and Jason offer advice for companies considering a shift to the cloud, stressing the importance of preparing good data and keeping time predictions realistic.

To start the show, Megan gives us a quick rundown of Kubernetes, an open-source tool to orchestrate containers and manage other GCP resources. She explains the difference between declarative and imperative to help us better understand the basics of Kubernetes.</p> <p>We tackle the challenges people face when beginning their Kubernetes journey and how it works with other open-source projects, like Anthos. This year, Megan and her team have been working to help developers understand the Kubernetes Resource Model, a concept that helps define how companies can organize and run clusters, enforce policies, and more for improved standardization across multiple teams.</p> <p>Megan explains GitOps, a deployment model for Kubernetes focusing on Git, and takes us through examples of implementation. We learn about Config Sync and how it helps with optimizing and automating GitOps. Megan goes over some other valuable tools, including Open Policy Agent and Gatekeeper, which help developers specify not just which resources are allowed, but also what kinds of things are allowed within each resource.</p> <p>We wrap up the show with a discussion on streamlining the development process with strategic use of Kubernetes and the help of open-source tools like Skaffold.

Our guests give more examples of how these tools improve logging tasks.</p> Philip O’Toole <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/general_order24\">Philip O’Toole</a> is an Engineering Manager at Google Pittsburgh, leading development teams working on GCP’s Cloud Logging Platform. Prior to Google he led development teams at InfluxDB, Loggly, and Riverbed Technology.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbrojbrojbro\">Jenny Brown</a> are your hosts this week, discussing data analytics with the yin and yang of the field, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brunoaziza\">Bruno Aziza</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">Eric Schmidt</a>. Our guests introduce us to three new Google offerings, BigQuery Omni, Dataplex, and the Analytics Hub, and discuss the uses and implications of each and how they work together to achieve goals.</p> <p>Bruno and Eric describe challenges in data analytics and how Google uses these as opportunities to create problem-solving systems that solve real client problems. Through real-world examples from companies like Equifax, we see how companies are getting more information from their data in a way that creates actionable opportunities to improve customer experiences.</p> <p>For multi-cloud companies, BigQuery Omni gets the most out of data that exists in multiple clouds. To accomplish this, Google takes the analytics to the data and is able to reach all appropriate data across clouds without having to move it. This allows for cheaper analysis with much less system downtime. Support for Azure was added this year.</p> <p>The new Dataplex software helps customers intelligently manage data assets, especially in distributed systems. Dataplex lets companies automatically discover data, make data secure without having to move it, and apply governance and policies centrally so the data is accessible. Rather than sit unused, data can now be found easily, analyzed securely, and put to work for companies no matter where their data lives.</p> <p>For analytic asset sharing, Analytics Hub lets companies coordinate with others to get the most use out of their data efficiently. Analytics Hub gets to data value as quickly and easily as possible. Companies can publish, discover, and subscribe to shared assets, create exchanges that combine data sets, and curate exchanges of data and insights for full information sharing.</p> <h5 id=\"eric-schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">Eric</a> is the Head of Advocacy for Data Analytics at Google and has been with us for almost 8 years. He comes to us from Microsoft, where he led Advocacy and Evangelism there, too. Eric is an expert in products like BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc and leads a team of leaders who help customers turn data into value. In his downtime, Eric is also a Dj at KEXP 90.3 Seattel - KEPX.ORG where he guest hosts a modern global music show. You can find Eric on Twitter. His handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">@notthateric</a> - not to be confused with the ‘other Eric Schmidt’ here at Google. In fact, internally, we affectionately call him “cloude”.</p> <h5 id=\"bruno-aziza\">Bruno Aziza</h5> <p>Bruno is the Head of Data & Analytics at Google Cloud and specializes in everything data, from data analytics, to business intelligence, data science, and artificial intelligence.</p> <p>Before working at Google, Bruno worked at companies like Business Objects when it went IPO and Oracle, where his team led one of the fastest turnarounds in the business analytics industry.

      "content:encoded": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbrojbrojbro\">Jenny Brown</a> are your hosts this week, discussing data analytics with the yin and yang of the field, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brunoaziza\">Bruno Aziza</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">Eric Schmidt</a>. Our guests introduce us to three new Google offerings, BigQuery Omni, Dataplex, and the Analytics Hub, and discuss the uses and implications of each and how they work together to achieve goals.</p> <p>Bruno and Eric describe challenges in data analytics and how Google uses these as opportunities to create problem-solving systems that solve real client problems. Through real-world examples from companies like Equifax, we see how companies are getting more information from their data in a way that creates actionable opportunities to improve customer experiences.</p> <p>For multi-cloud companies, BigQuery Omni gets the most out of data that exists in multiple clouds. To accomplish this, Google takes the analytics to the data and is able to reach all appropriate data across clouds without having to move it. This allows for cheaper analysis with much less system downtime. Support for Azure was added this year.</p> <p>The new Dataplex software helps customers intelligently manage data assets, especially in distributed systems. Dataplex lets companies automatically discover data, make data secure without having to move it, and apply governance and policies centrally so the data is accessible. Rather than sit unused, data can now be found easily, analyzed securely, and put to work for companies no matter where their data lives.</p> <p>For analytic asset sharing, Analytics Hub lets companies coordinate with others to get the most use out of their data efficiently. Analytics Hub gets to data value as quickly and easily as possible. Companies can publish, discover, and subscribe to shared assets, create exchanges that combine data sets, and curate exchanges of data and insights for full information sharing.</p> Eric Schmidt <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">Eric</a> is the Head of Advocacy for Data Analytics at Google and has been with us for almost 8 years. He comes to us from Microsoft, where he led Advocacy and Evangelism there, too. Eric is an expert in products like BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc and leads a team of leaders who help customers turn data into value. In his downtime, Eric is also a Dj at KEXP 90.3 Seattel - KEPX.ORG where he guest hosts a modern global music show. You can find Eric on Twitter. His handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notthateric\">@notthateric</a> - not to be confused with the ‘other Eric Schmidt’ here at Google. In fact, internally, we affectionately call him “cloude”.</p> Bruno Aziza <p>Bruno is the Head of Data & Analytics at Google Cloud and specializes in everything data, from data analytics, to business intelligence, data science, and artificial intelligence.</p> <p>Before working at Google, Bruno worked at companies like Business Objects when it went IPO and Oracle, where his team led one of the fastest turnarounds in the business analytics industry. He led the launch of startups like Alpine Data (now part of Tibco), Sisense and AtScale and he helped Microsoft grow its Data unit into a $1B business. Bruno has been educated in the US, France, the UK, and Germany. He has written two books on Data Analytics and Performance Management. And he has a monthly column on Forbes.com on everything Data, AI and Analytics.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>BigQuery row-level security enables more granular access to data <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/bigquery-provides-tighter-controls-over-data-access\"> blog</a></li> <li>Expanding access to quantum today for a better tomorrow <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/ionq-quantum-computer-available-through-google-cloud\"> blog</a></li> <li>Expanding partner solutions at the network edge <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/expanding-partner-solutions-at-the-network-edge?es_id=aeba4798c6\"> blog</a></li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li>Data Cloud Summit <a href= \"https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-data-cloud?utm_source=cloud_sfdc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaignFY21-Q2-NORTHAM-summit-onlineevent-er-gc-data-cloud-summit=&utm_contentgen-reg-invite-emails-calendar=\"> site</a></li> <li>Bringing multi-cloud analytics to your data with BigQuery Omni <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-bigquery-omni\"> blog</a></li> <li>Dataplex <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/dataplex\">site</a></li> <li>Analytics Hub <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/analytics-hub\">site</a></li> <li>Intelligent Data and Analytics Fabric <a href= \"https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-data-cloud?talk=t2_s2_intelligent_data_analytics\"> video</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 253: Data Governance with Jessi Ashdown and Uri Gilad <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-253-data-governance-with-jessi-ashdown-and-uri-gilad/\"> podcast</a></li> <li>Public Data Sets <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/solutions/datasets\">site</a></li> <li>Smart analytics reference patterns <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview\"> site</a></li> <li>Data and Analytics Sharing at Equifax: Immediate, Interconnected, Scalable, and Secure <a href= \"https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-data-cloud?talk=t2_s3_data_analytics_sharing_equifax\"> video</a></li> <li>BigQuery ML <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs\">site</a></li> <li>Learn more about these launches <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG1mOPMXJvw\">site</a></li> </ul> What’s something cool you’re working on? <p>Jenny has been working on <a href= \"https://feeds.transistor.fm/google-cloud-reader\">Google Cloud Reader episodes</a> on BigQuery Explained.</p>",

SRE is Google’s way of helping companies of all sizes create consistent, predictable, and functional projects. It helps clients approach operations from a software engineering stand point so that growing systems can be managed efficiently.</p> <p>We talk about the challenges of implementing best SRE practices and how companies can overcome these.

Steve and Yuri tell us the process they go through with customers to help them set realistic goals and work to make reliable, scalable projects with little downtime. By starting small and taking wins early, Steve says clients reap the rewards of SRE and are encouraged to push forward. Yuri’s customer-centric approach encourages companies to prioritize alerts that affect the user experience, thus limiting inbox mayhem and keeping customers happy. Alerts based on symptoms, Steve says, help accomplish this goal.</p> <p>Later, Yuri and Steve describe the best ways for companies to get started with SRE.

Developers can focus on the experience they want to create, then decide which platforms to run on. With Dart, Google provides business logic that allows developers to provide the front end and back end experience for users in one programming language. Our guests talk about the types of projects that will benefit most from the use of Dart and how Dart is expanding to offer more features and better usability. Flutter offers a high fidelity, rich framework that supports mobile and can be deployed on any platform.

Developers can focus on the experience they want to create, then decide which platforms to run on. With Dart, Google provides business logic that allows developers to provide the front end and back end experience for users in one programming language. Our guests talk about the types of projects that will benefit most from the use of Dart and how Dart is expanding to offer more features and better usability. Flutter offers a high fidelity, rich framework that supports mobile and can be deployed on any platform.

When designing and building machine learning projects, it’s important to plan and integrate functions that support a responsible model as well. Tracy and Craig help us understand the process of designing and building these responsible, efficient projects, from problem identification and data set collection and refinement to ethical model considerations and finally project construction.</p> <p>Part of Responsible AI is considering all the stakeholders of a project and how they will be impacted. Through examples, Tracy demonstrates how businesses can decide if the software solution affects stakeholders in a way the business would be proud of. Starting in the planning stages and continuing through data collection and model training, companies employing responsible AI techniques will consider input from groups that may use or be affected by the model, from social scientist who specialize in human behavior, and others. Craig elaborates on these principles in the context of Vertex AI and how the time savings of Vertex could be used to make thoughtful, responsible AI decisions.</p> <p>Craig teaches us more about Vertex as we wrap up the interview.

Document AI uses artificial intelligence to improve the way businesses create and manage things like paystubs, tax forms, contracts, and virtually any other business document. Data normally stored on paper can be parsed, enriched, and structured, then stored securely with the use of Document AI. Data becomes more accessible and more manageable.</p> <p>Our guests go on to describe the process of using this powerful tool and instances where developers and enterprise companies could benefit. We talk about Lending DocAI and Procurement DocAI and how offerings like Google Vision and Knowledge Graph enhance these powerful tools. Users of Document AI can take advantage of these tools as well as bring their own expertise to create custom models.</p> <p>Later, we learn about the developer experience when using the Document AI Platform. Our guests talk specifically about the use of Knowledge Graph and how the advanced search capabilities allow Document AI users to collect data from myriad sources, filling in missing information and enhancing the search with other useful data to make your results more usable.

GKE Autopilot manages tasks like quantity and size of nodes so deploying workloads is faster and machines are used efficiently. Autopilot also offers cluster management options, including monitoring the health of nodes and other components.</p> <p>William and Yochay explain that GKE Autopilot was built to aid companies in the efficient use of resources and give clients more time to focus on their projects. Important efficiency features that are optional in GKE, like multidimensional pod autoscaling, are employed automatically for clients in Autopilot, giving clients peace of mind. Kubernetes best practices are auto-deployed for projects so clients can rest assured things will run as quickly and smoothly as possible without extra work.</p> <p>Kubernetes is a great way to manage containers, and our guests describe cases where this tool is best suited. We compare GKE standard mode and Autopilot, and Yochay tells us when developers might choose standard mode to allow for more specific customization. He talks about migrating between standard and Autopilot clusters with the goal of easy migration by the end of this year. Security is important for GKE, and we talk about the Autopilot security configurations and why they were chosen.</p> <p>Later, our guests walk us through the process of a Kubernetes project on Autopilot, highlighting decisions this tool makes automatically for you and why.

Kendal Smith, program manager for Carbon Intelligent Computing, and Chris Talbott, leader of the sustainability product marketing efforts at Google Cloud, start the show telling us why sustainability is so important in the tech world.</p> <p>Environmentally conscious data centers are an important part of Google Cloud sustainability efforts. Using computing in the smartest way possible, Kendall tells us, is the root of green computing. Wind, solar, and other low or carbon-free energy sources are employed at Google Cloud data centers to accomplish this goal. Kendall and Chris detail the green goals Google has met or exceeded, including carbon neutrality in 2007, and future goals for Google.</p> <p>Chris explains how Google Cloud customers have taken advantage of Google’s sustainability practices and been inspired in their own businesses. Kendall details the Carbon Intelligent Computing Platform and how they adjust compute times to align with available carbon-free energy. We hear about Google’s sustainability metrics, including the Carbon Free Energy Percentage, and how these measurements can help Google and its customers run environmentally friendly applications. Chris describes the process he and his team go through when helping Google clients design their carbon aware strategy.</p> <p>To wrap up the show, our guests talk about the future of de-carbonized computing at Google.</p> <h5 id=\"kendal-smith\">Kendal Smith</h5> <p>Kendal is the Program Manager for Carbon Intelligent Computing at Google, which reduces the carbon footprint of Data Centers by exploiting flexibility in compute workloads.

Kendal Smith, program manager for Carbon Intelligent Computing, and Chris Talbott, leader of the sustainability product marketing efforts at Google Cloud, start the show telling us why sustainability is so important in the tech world.</p> <p>Environmentally conscious data centers are an important part of Google Cloud sustainability efforts. Using computing in the smartest way possible, Kendall tells us, is the root of green computing. Wind, solar, and other low or carbon-free energy sources are employed at Google Cloud data centers to accomplish this goal. Kendall and Chris detail the green goals Google has met or exceeded, including carbon neutrality in 2007, and future goals for Google.</p> <p>Chris explains how Google Cloud customers have taken advantage of Google’s sustainability practices and been inspired in their own businesses. Kendall details the Carbon Intelligent Computing Platform and how they adjust compute times to align with available carbon-free energy. We hear about Google’s sustainability metrics, including the Carbon Free Energy Percentage, and how these measurements can help Google and its customers run environmentally friendly applications. Chris describes the process he and his team go through when helping Google clients design their carbon aware strategy.</p> <p>To wrap up the show, our guests talk about the future of de-carbonized computing at Google.</p> Kendal Smith <p>Kendal is the Program Manager for Carbon Intelligent Computing at Google, which reduces the carbon footprint of Data Centers by exploiting flexibility in compute workloads. She also helps Google engineers build products efficiently, as well as advise other Bets on carbon measurement and tracking.</p> Chris Talbott <p>Chris leads sustainability product marketing and customer engagement efforts for Google Cloud, and works on opening new Google Cloud data centers throughout the globe. He helps customers improve the environmental impact of their IT operations and identify new opportunities to tackle climate change challenges with cloud technology.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>Active Assist’s new feature, predictive autoscaling, helps improve response times for your applications <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/solutions/active-assist\">site</a></li> <li>Maximizing developer productivity <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypfRNRmaXk\">video</a></li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li>Google Carbon Aware Computing Workshop 2021 <a href= \"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeo6O4-RNGex3k0Ci1qiDw1vgUOedbTbKii7-YZ2cqJCgvW3g/viewform?resourcekey=0-OWLZFWcuUjH5N2lzDa12dw\"> site</a></li> <li>Our data centers now work harder when the sun shines and wind blows <a href= \"https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/data-centers-work-harder-sun-shines-wind-blows/\"> blog</a></li> <li>How carbon-free is your cloud?

      "description": "<p>Hosts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pvergadia\">Priyanka Vergadia</a> learn about data governance this week in an interesting chat with Jessi Ashdown and Uri Gilad. While data governance includes security measures, the overarching term also means knowing your data, where it is, and how to use it. In their book, Jessi, Uri, and their co-authors hope to make data governance more accessible by sharing the knowledge Google has developed over twenty plus years.</p> <p>We talk about the challenges companies of all sizes face implementing data governance frameworks and Uri shares a few tips for streamlining the process. Communication and prioritization are important no matter the size of your team. Companies must also understand the sensitivity of the data, how it’s protected and managed, and why it’s collected.</p> <p>Having a thoughtful, thorough understanding of what data gives you the most bang for your buck can help companies prioritize certain data collection, make better decisions, scale efficiently, and save money. When communicating with team members, it’s important to share vital information about the data. Knowing who’s in charge of what data, for example, makes accessing that data faster. With proper communication and thorough prioritization, teams can begin to think about how developing automated tools can increase functional data utilization.</p> <p>Later, we discuss the ways companies can support employees on the data governance journey by clearly communicating the best practice rules. Uri describes how Google uses data governance principles and shares resources Google has published that detail these steps further. Tools like BigQuery and Data Catalog are Google-built products meant to provide companies with more automated data governance solutions.</p> <p>Jessi and Uri wrap up the show with some more best practices in the data governance sphere, like proper metadata to increase the trustworthiness of data. And Uri details the tools Google Cloud has developed to make your data life easier, giving examples of companies putting these tools into practice.</p> <h5 id=\"jessi-ashdown\">Jessi Ashdown</h5> <p>Jessi Ashdown is a User Experience Researcher for Google Cloud who conducts user studies with customers from all over the world and uses the findings and feedback from these studies to help inform and shape Google’s data governance products to best serve those users’ needs.</p> <h5 id=\"uri-gilad\">Uri Gilad</h5> <p>Uri is leading the Data Governance efforts, within the Data Analytics area in Google Cloud. As part of his role, Uri is spearheading a cross-functional effort to create the relevant controls, management tools and workflows that enable a GCP customer to apply Data Governance policies in a unified fashion wherever your data may be in your GCP deployment.</p> <p>Prior to Google, Uri served as an executive in multiple Data Security companies: most recently as the VP of product in MobileIron, a public Zero Trust/Endpoint security platform.

      "content:encoded": "<p>Hosts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephr_wong\">Stephanie Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pvergadia\">Priyanka Vergadia</a> learn about data governance this week in an interesting chat with Jessi Ashdown and Uri Gilad. While data governance includes security measures, the overarching term also means knowing your data, where it is, and how to use it. In their book, Jessi, Uri, and their co-authors hope to make data governance more accessible by sharing the knowledge Google has developed over twenty plus years.</p> <p>We talk about the challenges companies of all sizes face implementing data governance frameworks and Uri shares a few tips for streamlining the process. Communication and prioritization are important no matter the size of your team. Companies must also understand the sensitivity of the data, how it’s protected and managed, and why it’s collected.</p> <p>Having a thoughtful, thorough understanding of what data gives you the most bang for your buck can help companies prioritize certain data collection, make better decisions, scale efficiently, and save money. When communicating with team members, it’s important to share vital information about the data. Knowing who’s in charge of what data, for example, makes accessing that data faster. With proper communication and thorough prioritization, teams can begin to think about how developing automated tools can increase functional data utilization.</p> <p>Later, we discuss the ways companies can support employees on the data governance journey by clearly communicating the best practice rules. Uri describes how Google uses data governance principles and shares resources Google has published that detail these steps further. Tools like BigQuery and Data Catalog are Google-built products meant to provide companies with more automated data governance solutions.</p> <p>Jessi and Uri wrap up the show with some more best practices in the data governance sphere, like proper metadata to increase the trustworthiness of data. And Uri details the tools Google Cloud has developed to make your data life easier, giving examples of companies putting these tools into practice.</p> Jessi Ashdown <p>Jessi Ashdown is a User Experience Researcher for Google Cloud who conducts user studies with customers from all over the world and uses the findings and feedback from these studies to help inform and shape Google’s data governance products to best serve those users’ needs.</p> Uri Gilad <p>Uri is leading the Data Governance efforts, within the Data Analytics area in Google Cloud. As part of his role, Uri is spearheading a cross-functional effort to create the relevant controls, management tools and workflows that enable a GCP customer to apply Data Governance policies in a unified fashion wherever your data may be in your GCP deployment.</p> <p>Prior to Google, Uri served as an executive in multiple Data Security companies: most recently as the VP of product in MobileIron, a public Zero Trust/Endpoint security platform. Uri was an early employee and a manager in CheckPoint and Forescout - two well known Security brands. Uri holds an M.sc from Tel Aviv University and a B.sc from the Technion, Israel’s Institute of Technology.

It means running your application the best possible way and accommodating things like traffic spikes while keeping costs as low as possible. As our guests tell us, standard best practices can aid in optimization, but when it comes to efficiently running on a budget, there are more tips and tricks available in GKE. One of GKE’s newest operation modes, Autopilot, means Kubernetes nodes are now managed by Google. Customers pay by the pod so the focus can be on the application rather than the details of clusters and their optimization. Best practices for resource utilization and autoscaling are included with Autopilot.</p> <p>Kaslin and Anthony break up Google’s GKE cost optimization tips into four categories: multi-tenancy, autoscaling, infrastructure choice, and workload best practices and tell us how company culture effects these decisions. Proper education around Kubernetes and GKE specifically is the first step to using resources the most efficiently, Anthony tells us. Keeping tenants separate and resources well managed on multi-tenant clusters is made easier with Namespaces. Scaling pods and the infrastructure around them is an important part of optimization as well, and Anthony helps us understand the best practices for fine tuning the autoscaling features in GKE. Scaling infrastructure to handle spikes or lulls is an automatic feature with Autopilot, helping projects run smoothly. To control workloads efficiency, GKE now offers a host of features, including horizontal, vertical, and multidimensional pod autoscaling.</p> <p>Later, we walk through the steps for implementing some of these optimizations decisions while keeping your application running. GKE Usage Metering is a useful tool for measuring tenant usage in a cluster so resource distribution can be managed easier.</p> <h5 id=\"kaslin-fields\">Kaslin Fields</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaslinfields\">Kaslin</a> is a Developer Advocate at Google Cloud where she focuses on Google Kubernetes Engine.</p> <h5 id=\"anthony-bushong\">Anthony Bushong</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/agmsbush\">Anthony</a> is a Specialist Customer Engineer at Google Cloud, where he focuses on Kubernetes.</p> <h5 id=\"cool-things-of-the-week\">Cool things of the week</h5> <ul> <li>A2 VMs now GA—the largest GPU cloud instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/a2-vms-with-nvidia-a100-gpus-are-ga\"> blog</a></li> <li>How carbon-free is your cloud?

This year marks ten years since the launch of the first Chromebooks, and our guests, Angela Gosz and Courtney Harrison, are here to reflect on the past and talk about the future Chrome OS. Chromebooks powered by Intel allow users to get the most out of their endpoints, serving as a secure and stable entrypoint to the Cloud.</p> <p>Our guests describe the key groups of Chromebook users and how the security, ease of use, and portability of Chrome OS benefits each group. The Google Admin Console allows more than 500 customizable security features to tailor the experience for employees or end customers, Angela explains. The changes brought on by the pandemic meant more companies had to support a distributed business, and Chrome OS has been able to facilitate this transition easily. With zero-touch enrollment, Chromebooks can be sent directly to employees, bypassing IT. Chromebooks can be configured through the Google Admin Console without any physical contact.</p> <p>Courtney tells us about her experiences with Chrome OS at Intel and how the automatic updates, computing speed, and other features have made her job easier. She explains the process of working with Google to develop Chromebook hardware and how the cloud comes into play for maximum performance. We talk about the many Chromebook options offered and what options will be available in the future.</p> <h5 id=\"angela-gosz\">Angela Gosz</h5> <p>Angela Gosz is a Customer Success Manager on the Chrome Enterprise Team, based out of Google Chicago.

Using a real-life example of bus cameras detecting potholes, Dale and Craig walk us through the steps of designing, building, implementing, and improving on a piece of machine learning software.</p> <p>The first step, Craig tells us, is to identify the data collected and determine its viability in an ML model. He describes how to get the best data for your project and how to keep the data, code, and libraries consistent to allow better analysis by your ML models. He talks about the importance of a Feature Store to aid in data consistency. Craig explains how machine learning pipelines like TensorFlow are great tools to improve consistency in the ML environment as well, making it easier to improve your model and even to build new ones using the same data. Keeping this consistency from data scientist analyzation to ML developer to model deployment means a more efficient process and product.</p> <p>Evaluating models after production is an important step in the lifecycle as well to ensure accuracy, validity, and performance of the model. Craig gives us some examples and tips on monitoring models after they’ve been deployed. We talk about the challenges of scaling ML projects and Craig offers advice for developers and companies looking to build ML projects.</p> <h5 id=\"dale-markowitz\">Dale Markowitz</h5> <p>Dale Markowitz is an Applied AI Engineer for ML on Google Cloud.

Our guests this week, Dilraj Kaur and Christoph Bussler, describe Cloud Spanner as a fully managed relational database that boasts unlimited scaling and advanced consistency and availability.</p> <p>Unlimited scaling truly means unlimited, and Chris explains why Cloud Spanner offers this feature and how it’s making database design and development easier. Dilraj and Chris tell us all about the cool new features Spanner has developed, like generated columns and foreign keys, and how customer needs influenced these developments. Chris walks us through the process of using some of these new features, including how developers can monitor their database systems.</p> <p>Managed backups and multi-region configuration are additional recent additions to Cloud Spanner, and our guests explain how these are used by current enterprise clients. Dilraj and Chris explain the automatically managed features of Spanner versus the customer managed features and how people set up and manage database projects. We hear examples of companies using Cloud Spanner and how it has improved their businesses.</p> <h5 id=\"dilraj-kaur\">Dilraj Kaur</h5> <p>Dilraj Kaur is an Enterprise Customer Engineer with specialization in Data Management.

Our guests this week, Dilraj Kaur and Christoph Bussler, describe Cloud Spanner as a fully managed relational database that boasts unlimited scaling and advanced consistency and availability.</p> <p>Unlimited scaling truly means unlimited, and Chris explains why Cloud Spanner offers this feature and how it’s making database design and development easier. Dilraj and Chris tell us all about the cool new features Spanner has developed, like generated columns and foreign keys, and how customer needs influenced these developments. Chris walks us through the process of using some of these new features, including how developers can monitor their database systems.</p> <p>Managed backups and multi-region configuration are additional recent additions to Cloud Spanner, and our guests explain how these are used by current enterprise clients. Dilraj and Chris explain the automatically managed features of Spanner versus the customer managed features and how people set up and manage database projects. We hear examples of companies using Cloud Spanner and how it has improved their businesses.</p> Dilraj Kaur <p>Dilraj Kaur is an Enterprise Customer Engineer with specialization in Data Management.

This powerful tool enables developers to diagnose database issues for faster, smoother performance.</p> <p>Nimesh tells us the inspiration for Cloud SQL Insight’s development and describes its biggest benefits. One of the important aspects of Insights is the ability for developers to gain an application-centric view by allowing them to tag database queries with SQL comments. These tags are aggregated in Insights and give developers a visual of the database queries. Here, developers can see load patterns and use that information to improve database efficiency. Cloud SQL Insights offers managed database analysis that helps developers understand the past and predict the future.</p> <p>Simplifying the journey of database debugging, Nimesh explains, was the goal of creating Cloud SQL Insights. He takes us through the process of using the software, pointing out the improvements Insights makes over the old way. Cloud SQL Insights only launched in January, but it’s already helping numerous clients with their projects.

In his spare time he plays with his dog, trains martial arts, and reads too much fantasy literature.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>Google Cloud Docs Samples <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/docs/samples\">docs</a></li> <li>Limiting public IPs on Google Cloud <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/limiting-public-ips-google-cloud\"> blog</a></li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li>Google Cloud Game Servers <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/game-servers\">site</a></li> <li>Agones <a href=\"https://agones.dev/site/\">site</a></li> <li>Agones Prerequisite Knowledge <a href= \"https://agones.dev/site/docs/prerequisite-knowledge/\">docs</a></li> <li>Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io\">site</a></li> <li>GKE <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine\">site</a></li> <li>Online Game Technology, Drawn Badly <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tv4Z4FcD74&list=PLqqp1QEhKwa4HMSkngHif8l-Uoc_haa4c\"> videos</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 142: Agones with Mark Mandel and Cyril Tovena <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-142-agones-with-mark-mandel-and-cyril-tovena/\"> podcast</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 202: Supersolid with Kami May <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-202-supersolid-with-kami-may/\"> podcast</a></li> <li>Multiplay <a href=\"https://multiplay.com\">site</a></li> <li>Accelbyte <a href=\"https://accelbyte.io\">site</a></li> <li>Improbable <a href= \"https://www.improbable.io/multiplayer-operations\">site</a></li> <li>Find the right Google Cloud partner <a href= \"https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/?metadataExpertiseTypes=GAMING_EXPERTISE&sort-type=RELEVANCE\"> site</a></li> <li>Game Developers Conference <a href= \"https://gdconf.com\">site</a></li> <li>Agones on Slack <a href= \"https://agones.slack.com/join/shared_invite/en\">site</a></li> <li>Agones on Twitter <a href= \"https://twitter.com/agonesdev\">site</a></li> <li>Mark Mandel on Twitch <a href= \"https://www.twitch.tv/markmandel\">site</a></li> <li>Mark Mandel on YouTube <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCviD9easAslHLWQ5RH1GCzg/videos\">site</a></li> </ul> What’s something cool you’re working on? <p>Stephanie is working on <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibc34NztJWw&list=PLIivdWyY5sqKRzuCV5BejHJ3YoE-Sd8ku\"> Season of Scale season 5</a> and a <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd33UVZhnAA\">data center</a> animated series that will launch in a few weeks!</p> Sound Effects Attribution <ul> <li>“TrumpetBrassFanfare.wav” by ohforheavensake of <a href= \"https://Freesound.org\">Freesound.org</a></li> <li>“8-bit Video Game Sounds.wav” by ProjectsU012 of <a href= \"https://Freesound.org\">Freesound.org</a></li> <li>“music elevator.wav” by Jay_You of <a href= \"https://Freesound.org\">Freesound.org</a></li> </ul>",

Botcopy uses advanced AI technology along with excellent copy writing to create better chat bots. The software works directly on a company website and doesn’t require a login, allowing chats to stay anonymous.</p> <p>Our guests explain that their chat bots are treated like virtual employees, built and trained to function and speak appropriately for their specific job. Copy writing is an important part of this, as the conversational AI should continue to support the brand being represented and conversations should flow naturally. The bot personalities are developed through written copy and interactions with customers in instances like customer service, lead generation, and even some internal employee management needs.</p> <p>Later, we talk about how Dialogflow and Botcopy work together, including how Botcopy adds important user context to the conversation to facilitate more accurate bot responses. We hear more about Dialogflow CX and how the modular builder makes designing and controlling bot conversations easier. CX has also made managing multiple bots on a single account easier and team collaboration more efficient. The visual builder available in CX offers a better chatbot design experience, especially when multiple teams are working on the same bot. We hear examples of great use-cases for Botcopy, like restaurant menus, clinical trials, and more.</p> <p>Alex and Dustin give developers valuable advice about working with clients to build their bots. Test early and often to build a robust bot capable of handling many situations. It’s important to have an analytics system in place to identify possible improvement areas as well.</p> <h5 id=\"dustin-dye\">Dustin Dye</h5> <p>Dustin Dye is co-founder and CEO of Botcopy. After developing branded character and dialogue content for the #1 business bots on Messenger and Slack, Dustin launched Botcopy in 2017. Before co-founding Botcopy, Dustin had co-founded Expert Dojo, one of Silicon Beach’s largest startup incubator, serving, mentoring, and securing funding for some of the most exciting businesses coming out of LA. Dustin is a frequent keynote speaker at leading Chatbot conferences in the US and abroad.</p> <h5 id=\"alexander-seegers\">Alexander Seegers</h5> <p>Alexander Seegers is a co-founder and COO of Botcopy and heads up the product team.

Our guests, James Parr and Madhulika Guhathakurta, give us a super cool, in-depth look at how NASA and FDL do what they do. Lika explains the important scientific studies she has worked on during her years at NASA and how she came to understand and appreciate Machine Learning. James introduces us to the Frontier Development Lab, a project collaborated on by private and public companies to leverage AI and Machine Learning in the research of science, exploration, and many other disciplines.</p> <p>From saving Earth from asteroids to conducting research on our sun, James describes the process of solving these solar system sized problems, starting with creating a solid team. Machine Learning is a team sport, he says, and like making a Hollywood film, it takes many people from different backgrounds to find these solutions. The cloud has been integral in facilitating this meeting of the minds and the analyzing of data at FDL.</p> <p>Later, we talk about the process of astronomical research before the current technological age and how techniques have advanced into the 21st century. James tells us the origin story of FDL and how they were tasked with applying Machine Learning to complex problems like planetary defense and space weather. Lika describes space weather and details how it impacts our planet. We talk about the role of data engineers in the team sport of astro-research and how data is collected and analyzed. Lika emphasizes the benefits of building a working system and how the processes can be applied to many other disciplines.</p> <p>James and Lika wrap up the show with a look at what cool things they expect in the future.</p> <h5 id=\"james-parr\">James Parr</h5> <p>James is Director of the Frontier Development Lab, in partnership with NASA ARC and the SETI Institute.

Kelly’s main focus at Google, reCAPTCHA, is a service that helps online companies determine if a user is a human or an automated system. With an advanced risk analysis engine, Google’s reCAPTCHA system has been defending sites from fraud for more than a decade. We talk about the evolution of reCAPTCHA and learn about the specific attributes of each version.</p> <p>Later, we focus on reCAPTCHA Enterprise which caters this security software to enterprise companies. Like version three, Enterprise boasts detailed risk analysis and actions. Companies can also expect reason codes for high risk scores and the ability to use the risk analysis engine customized to their company. They are able to find bots impersonating users and neutralize them easily. reCAPTCHA Enterprise is easy to use, whether you’re a Google Cloud customer or not. With the handy API, any company can take advantage of this security feature. Kelly leads us through the steps of deploying the API and details instances where this software plays a vital role in the protection of your website across multiple devices.</p> <p>Kelly takes us through the reCAPTCHA Enterprise dashboard and talks about the future as we conclude the show. reCAPTCHA hopes to move beyond behavioral protection to continue to stay ahead of malicious actors online. As Kelly explains, Machine Learning will become more and more important as fraud detection continues to grow and change.</p> <h5 id=\"kelly-anderson\">Kelly Anderson</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kellyanderson93\">Kelly Anderson</a> currently leads product marketing for Google Cloud’s online fraud protection business.

The Cloud Learning Services team is passionate about helping technical practitioners elevate their careers and transform businesses by building and validating in-demand Google Cloud skills. Nandhini explains that a lack of technical practitioners with skills in the cloud is one of the biggest barriers to entry for companies considering the shift. But with the right knowledge, companies that take full advantage of cloud environments are proven to be more efficient, reach more of their goals, and overall, be more successful. Cloud Learning Services offerings empower technical practitioners and companies to learn new skills, put these skills into practice, and achieve their objectives.</p> <p>Magda tells us that these training courses focus around job roles in the cloud. The cloud has necessitated a shift in the idea of development learning, she tells us, explaining that nowadays, the focus is on job roles, like Data Scientist, and the technological requirements of that job rather than learning one coding language.</p> <p>We talk later about the specific offerings Cloud Learning Services provides. With a focus on hands-on learning, technical practitioners are put into the real Google Cloud environment with Qwiklabs, while videos and lectures accompany the material. Job-specific skill badges and certifications are earned as courses are completed, allowing technical practitioners and employers to better understand what proficiency in each job role looks like. Our guests tell us more about Qwiklabs and how its sandbox environment facilitates better learning without the added cost and commitment of services that they may not be ready to use. When the time for real-world development comes, this hands-on approach means no disconnect between learning and applying. We talk more about the Challenge Labs used to test learning and the skill badges earned on completion.</p> <p>To wrap up, we discuss the future of Cloud Learning Services and how the team stays on top of new technologies and job roles to keep learning materials updated and fun.

Bryan and his team focus on using deep learning to enhance NVIDIA’s offerings.</p> <p>Since Bryan was last a guest on the show, NVIDIA has been doing some amazing things. We talk about the A100 Tensor Core GPU and the massive effort it took to create, the new RTX graphics cards great for gaming, and the differences between them. Bryan explains how the new A100 chips compare to the previous versions, saying the new chips are larger, but with almost three times the power, making them ideal for things like precise calculations. And, as Bryan says, with better computation and more insight, we can make discoveries that benefit humanity. While the new RTX graphic cards are cheaper than previous versions, they are faster and more powerful, making gaming and video streaming much more enjoyable. Background noises and objects can even be removed with the help of deep learning.</p> <p>Jon and Bryan talk about The Black Box at NVIDIA and what demos Jon hopes to see on his next visit. With this as the catalyst, Bryan talks more about how the NVIDIA architecture and the deep learning they employ have created efficient 8k graphics rendering for truly powerful gaming experiences. Outside of gaming, DLSS could have farther reaching benefits as the model learns new purposes, and Bryan talks us through some fun examples.</p> <p>With the acquisitions of Mellanox and ARM, Bryan explains that NVIDIA has been able to streamline networking and really take advantage of powerful performance at all stages.

As companies scale, these features become even more important, Chris tells us, citing examples from real users.</p> <p>Later, we talk about how machine learning is employed to create these recommendations. We talk transparency and learn how Chris and his team keep open communication with clients as they design and improve client security structures. In the future, the Active Assist team will continue to work with departments across Google Cloud and build more recommendations tools for customers.

Later, we hear examples of companies taking advantage of everything GKE has to offer and how the symbiotic relationship between Google and its customers has helped GKE grow. In the world of gaming, GKE’s global scaling capabilities have been vital.

Iron Mountain, a data management company, securely stores hard-copy and online data for enterprise customers. SpringML aides enterprises in the use of data analytics and machine learning to transform their projects. With the help of SpringML and Google Cloud, Iron Mountain migrated much of their data to datalakes and cloud storage for easier access and manipulation of the data.</p> <p>Jarrett and Prabhu talk about the process of migrating so much data, including the main goals of their partnership. First, they established systems that could be repeated and help Iron Mountain understand when data is moved, destroyed, migrated, and more. We discuss the next steps taken, learning how Iron Mountain moved so much data to the cloud. Using Google products like DataFlow, BigQuery, and Cloud Composer, SpringML was able to take the data from Iron Mountain’s landing zone and transform it. Prior planning meant that the system was optimized and ready from the beginning, complete with automation and tools to make a fast, effective migration of data without any restructuring. Later, the data visualization is done by GSuite, Google Data Studio, and Looker so Iron Mountain and their customers can use the data for analysis.</p> <p>Later in the show, Jarrett describes real-life situations in which Iron Mountain has helped manage, migrate, and store data for customers. Prabhu details the lessons SpringML learned while working on this project and offers advice to other developers. He talks about the future of the project, explaining that now that the data has been migrated, more detailed analytics can be performed and machine learning projects added on to augment Iron Mountain’s offerings.</p> <h5 id=\"jarrett-garcia\">Jarrett Garcia</h5> <p>Jarrett Garcia recently joined Iron Mountain as the Director of Enterprise Data.

      "description": "<p>On the podcast this week, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/briandorsey\">Brian Dorsey</a> talk with fellow Googlers John Laham and Stewart Reichling about Traffic Director, a managed control plane for service mesh. Traffic Director solves many common networking problems developers face when breaking apart monoliths into multiple, manageable microservices. We start the conversation with some helpful definitions of terms like data plane (the plane that data passes through when one service calls on another) and service mesh (the art of helping these microservices speak with each other) and how Traffic Director and the Envoy Proxy use these concepts to streamline distributed services.</p> <p>Envoy Proxy can handle all sorts of networking solutions, from policy enforcement to routing, without adding hundreds of lines of code to each project piece. The proxy can receive a request, process it, and pass it on to the next correct piece, speeding up your distributed system processes. But Envoy can do more than the regular proxy. With its xDS APIs, services can configure proxies automatically, making the process much more efficient. In some instances, the same benefits developers see with a distributed system can be gained from distributed proxies as well. To make distributed proxy configuration easy and manageable, a managed control plane system like Traffic Director is the solution. Traffic Director not only helps you facilitate communication between microservices, it also syncs distributed states across regions, monitors your infrastructure, and more.</p> <h5 id=\"stewart-reichling\">Stewart Reichling</h5> <p>Stewart is a Product Manager on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), based out of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

      "content:encoded": "<p>On the podcast this week, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/briandorsey\">Brian Dorsey</a> talk with fellow Googlers John Laham and Stewart Reichling about Traffic Director, a managed control plane for service mesh. Traffic Director solves many common networking problems developers face when breaking apart monoliths into multiple, manageable microservices. We start the conversation with some helpful definitions of terms like data plane (the plane that data passes through when one service calls on another) and service mesh (the art of helping these microservices speak with each other) and how Traffic Director and the Envoy Proxy use these concepts to streamline distributed services.</p> <p>Envoy Proxy can handle all sorts of networking solutions, from policy enforcement to routing, without adding hundreds of lines of code to each project piece. The proxy can receive a request, process it, and pass it on to the next correct piece, speeding up your distributed system processes. But Envoy can do more than the regular proxy. With its xDS APIs, services can configure proxies automatically, making the process much more efficient. In some instances, the same benefits developers see with a distributed system can be gained from distributed proxies as well. To make distributed proxy configuration easy and manageable, a managed control plane system like Traffic Director is the solution. Traffic Director not only helps you facilitate communication between microservices, it also syncs distributed states across regions, monitors your infrastructure, and more.</p> Stewart Reichling <p>Stewart is a Product Manager on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), based out of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Lucidworks, a company specializing in information retrieval, strives to make data searching easier for developers and users. Building off Solr, Lucidworks created Fusion, an environment more conducive to easy AI-enhanced query capabilities, better scalability, and more. With Fusion, developers can take advantage of the highly advanced relevance tuning tools such as query rewrites, which analyze user behavior and automatically rewrite queries based on that information.</p> <p>On the tech side, Fusion was built with a combination of Java, Kubernetes to increase scalability, Solr management tools, and logging and reporting tools. The engineers at Lucidworks have created Fusion-specific system-enhancing pieces as well, including a machine learning service that allows data scientists to train their models elsewhere and plug them in for a completely customized experience. The team also created Smart Answers, which is a Q-And-A system built on a search engine that can connect to chatbots, virtual assistants, and others. Radu goes into detail explaining the Smart Answers system and how the layers of the project work together. We also learn about the customization capabilities and integration of Smart Answers.</p> <p>Radu wraps up the show with interesting use-case stories and how Fusion is working in the real world.

WebAssembly, technology originally created for web browsers, actually plays a role in Fastly’s edge platforms, Tyler explains, going further into the technical side of how the engineers at Fastly have created this system to run smoothly while also being easy to build on.</p> <p>In the future, Tyler hopes to see WebAssembly support more languages so compiling and distributing can be even easier.</p> Tyler McMullen <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tbmcmullen\">Tyler McMullen</a> is CTO at Fastly, a global edge cloud platform, where he is responsible for evolving the company’s system architecture and technology vision. He leads a team of experienced technology innovators focused on internet scale, and working on future-facing, ambitious projects and standards. As part of the founding team at Fastly, Tyler built the first versions of Fastly’s Instant Purging system, API, and Real-time Analytics. Prior to joining Fastly, Tyler worked on large scale web applications, text analysis, and performance. He can be found debating about edge computing, networking, and distributed systems all over the world.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>Week 1 recap of Google Cloud Next ‘20: OnAir <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/what-happened-week1-of-google-cloud-next20-onair\"> blog</a></li> <li>Introducing Google Cloud Confidential Computing with Confidential VMs <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-google-cloud-confidential-computing-with-confidential-vms\"> blog</a></li> <li>Next OnAir Sessions (Week 2) <a href= \"https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions#productivity-collaboration\"> site</a></li> <li>Introducing your new home for work in G Suite <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/introducing-your-new-home-for-work-in-gsuite\"> blog</a></li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li>Fastly <a href=\"https://www.fastly.com/\">site</a></li> <li>Reaching 100 Tbps of Capacity <a href= \"https://www.fastly.com/blog/fastly-reaches-100tbps-network-capacity\"> blog</a></li> <li>Fastly’s investment in WASM ecosystem <a href= \"https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-fastly-and-developer-community-invest-in-webassembly-ecosystem\"> blog</a></li> <li>Fastly’s Developer Hub <a href= \"https://developer.fastly.com/\">site</a></li> <li>Fastly’s Developer Hub: Everything you need to build on Fastly is now in one place <a href= \"https://www.fastly.com/blog/developer-hub-everything-developers-need-build-on-fastly\"> blog</a></li> <li>Bytecode Alliance <a href= \"https://bytecodealliance.org/\">site</a></li> <li>WebAssembly <a href=\"https://webassembly.org\">site</a></li> <li>BigQuery <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery\">site</a></li> <li>Fastly Labs <a href=\"https://www.fastlylabs.com\">site</a></li> <li>Altitude <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/376898177\">site</a></li> </ul> Tip of the week <p>We’re talking to Stephanie Wong about the <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/network-intelligence-center\">Network Intelligence Center</a> and her video series, <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNb7xKyya5c&list=PLIivdWyY5sqJ0oXcnZYqOnuNRsLF9H48u\"> GCP Networking End to End</a></p> What’s something cool you’re working on? <p>Brian is learning <a href= \"https://www.terraform.io\">Terraform</a>!</p> <p>Mark is working on more video content and his Next talk, CST103.</p>",

Our guests explain the importance of Cloud Audit Logs to keep track of your GCP resources so you know who, what, where, and when things were done. Our guests explain the types of logs GCP offers and why each is important for security. The interview continues with a discussion the various other benefits of audit logging, including proof of compliance and measuring of risk.</p> <p>Because audit logs have the ability to create more data than some businesses can use, Philip and Oscar help our listeners understand how to choose the correct logging services for their needs, and we learn how Cloud Logging can help users digest their data. Philip describes how audit logs and event driven systems can benefit businesses, explaining how event driven systems can be built and pushed with GCP. Oscar continues the conversation with audit logging in G Suite. The Cloud Logging team is continuing to expand offerings, so be on the lookout!</p> <h5 id=\"philip-o-toole\">Philip O’Toole</h5> <p>Philip O’Toole is an Engineering Manager at Google Pittsburgh, leading development teams working on GCP’s Cloud Logging Platform, including Audit Logging.

Our guests explain the importance of Cloud Audit Logs to keep track of your GCP resources so you know who, what, where, and when things were done. Our guests explain the types of logs GCP offers and why each is important for security. The interview continues with a discussion the various other benefits of audit logging, including proof of compliance and measuring of risk.</p> <p>Because audit logs have the ability to create more data than some businesses can use, Philip and Oscar help our listeners understand how to choose the correct logging services for their needs, and we learn how Cloud Logging can help users digest their data. Philip describes how audit logs and event driven systems can benefit businesses, explaining how event driven systems can be built and pushed with GCP. Oscar continues the conversation with audit logging in G Suite. The Cloud Logging team is continuing to expand offerings, so be on the lookout!</p> Philip O’Toole <p>Philip O’Toole is an Engineering Manager at Google Pittsburgh, leading development teams working on GCP’s Cloud Logging Platform, including Audit Logging.

BeyondCorp is Google’s answer to allowing employees to use company networks on any device while outside the building in a way that is both secure and efficient. Users are authenticated per session and per device to give access only to the specific person, on the specific device, for the specific job each time. In addition to the thorough authentication process, BeyondCorp continues to monitor device metadata during use as part of the system’s decision to continue to trust (or not trust) a user. With this information, if a user accidentally exposes the system to malware, for example, access can be revoked quickly.</p> <p>Max and Rob explain the steps Google went through to create such a state-of-the-art security program and give tips on how companies can build something similar. Codifying your employees’ needs and preferences, detailing the levels of trust you’ll allow, and thinking ahead about where in the world your employees will be when they access the system are some of their tips. Rob stresses how complicated the system was to build from scratch and emphasizes that with BeyondCorp Remote Access, companies don’t have to build a whole new system.</p> <p>BeyondCorp Remote Access offers automatic scaling and world-wide points of presence for a fast user experience anywhere in the world. Companies can define access rules for each user, setting trust levels and parameters for who can access what parts of the network.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pvergadia\">Priyanka Vergadia</a> hops back into the host seat this week, joining <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> to talk to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaritRodevand\">Marit Rødevand</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/striseai\">Strise</a>. Strise is an AI-driven enterprise company using knowledge graphs to gather and analyze massive amounts of information, depositing it into a web-based interface to help large clients such as banks solve data-driven problems. Strise’s web-based data platform is customizable, flexible, and capable of keeping up with the fast-paced world of technology so enterprise companies aren’t constantly putting time and resources into reworking old or building new software. To do this, Strise uses knowledge graphs rather than typical databases to create what Marit calls a future-proof data model.</p> <p>Marit explains knowledge graphs in detail, emphasizing that they can reduce training of machine models, allow new data to be input easily, and make analyzing unstructured data much easier. Knowledge graphs take data that would normally only make sense to humans and in effect translate it for computers. Using banking as an example, she details how information about customers can be collected and analyzed thoroughly to help the bank come to conclusions about credit-worthiness or possible criminal activity.</p> <p>On Strise’s platform, Marit tells us that the information is now available to the end user who provides feedback to the system, marking things as relevant or irrelevant, rather than leaving those decisions to a data scientist outside of the client’s field. This means that massive amounts of information could be stored in the knowledge graph, across many industries, and each user only gets the data he or she needs.</p> <p>Google Cloud tools such as Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, and Pub/Sub have played an integral roll in the creation of the Strise data pipeline. Marit explains how Strise gets their data, how it’s input into the knowledge graph, and how these Google tools help to keep Strise running.</p> <h5 id=\"marit-rødevand\">Marit Rødevand</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaritRodevand\">Marit Rødevand</a> is the CEO & co-founder of Strise, an AI startup from Norway who is signaling a new era of enterprise software.</p> <p>Strise makes the world’s information useful across the enterprise. Their novel approach by utilizing a knowledge graph to power their data platform, allows Strise to break data silos, end customization projects, and bring new insights from unstructured data.

Strise is an AI-driven enterprise company using knowledge graphs to gather and analyze massive amounts of information, depositing it into a web-based interface to help large clients such as banks solve data-driven problems. Strise’s web-based data platform is customizable, flexible, and capable of keeping up with the fast-paced world of technology so enterprise companies aren’t constantly putting time and resources into reworking old or building new software. To do this, Strise uses knowledge graphs rather than typical databases to create what Marit calls a future-proof data model.</p> <p>Marit explains knowledge graphs in detail, emphasizing that they can reduce training of machine models, allow new data to be input easily, and make analyzing unstructured data much easier. Knowledge graphs take data that would normally only make sense to humans and in effect translate it for computers. Using banking as an example, she details how information about customers can be collected and analyzed thoroughly to help the bank come to conclusions about credit-worthiness or possible criminal activity.</p> <p>On Strise’s platform, Marit tells us that the information is now available to the end user who provides feedback to the system, marking things as relevant or irrelevant, rather than leaving those decisions to a data scientist outside of the client’s field. This means that massive amounts of information could be stored in the knowledge graph, across many industries, and each user only gets the data he or she needs.</p> <p>Google Cloud tools such as Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, and Pub/Sub have played an integral roll in the creation of the Strise data pipeline. Marit explains how Strise gets their data, how it’s input into the knowledge graph, and how these Google tools help to keep Strise running.</p> Marit Rødevand <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaritRodevand\">Marit Rødevand</a> is the CEO & co-founder of Strise, an AI startup from Norway who is signaling a new era of enterprise software.</p> <p>Strise makes the world’s information useful across the enterprise. Their novel approach by utilizing a knowledge graph to power their data platform, allows Strise to break data silos, end customization projects, and bring new insights from unstructured data. Strise is currently helping leading Nordic banks and financial institutions to solve their hardest data-driven problems within KYC/AML, risk, and sales.</p> <p>Strise recently announced their Seed round from Maki.vc, the leading Nordic early stage investor, who invests in deep tech & brand-led startups.</p> <p>Marit has a background from Cybernetics & Robotics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

Working in the Open Developer Platform department, Josh supports third-party developers as they create music experiences for users using the Spotify APIs and SDKs.

Justin and Pathik, both of the Professional Services Organization, work to help customers get the most out of GCP while maintaining their project budgets. They help customers take business success metrics and track them from a cost perspective, allowing the client to get an understanding of how much each business goal actually costs, rather than an aggregate of how much has been spent in total. This information is used to tailor GCP product usage and cost optimization to each client project.</p> <p>Pathik explains how the Recommender API can help with VM usage by suggesting shrinking or removing a VM altogether for cost savings. With thorough analysis, clients can also benefit from cost savings by paying for longterm usage of GCP products rather than month-to-month. For storage and analysis, BigQuery can offer better performance at a lower cost with partitioning and clustering.</p> <p>Throughout the episode, Justin and Pathik offer up other tips and tricks to help our listeners save money with GCP, as well as suggested reading materials, videos, and labs to get you started on your cost optimization adventure.</p> <h5 id=\"pathik-sharma\">Pathik Sharma</h5> <p>Pathik Sharma is a Technical Account Manager with Google Cloud, focusing on proactively guiding enterprise customers to operate effectively and efficiently in the cloud.

      "description": "<p>Today on the podcast, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon Foust</a> is back with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> as we talk about SLOs and the importance of measuring service reliability with Alex Bramley. As a member of the Google SRE team, Alex and his coworkers help customers optimally run their services on Google Cloud. They collaborate with the client, weighing client needs and user needs to develop a plan that is affordable, efficient, and has the highest reliability for the user. Recently, they’ve been working to automate functions such as detection of outages, so that Google and the customer can work together quickly to get everything working smoothly again.</p> <p>Later, Alex, describes the steps developers go through at his workshop, The Art of SLOs, which was designed to help companies measure and improve reliability. At this workshop, attendees are encouraged to set SLO targets and error budgets. They are given theoretical reliability problems to solve, allowing them to practice without the added pressure of messy, real-world problems. The Art of SLOs helps developers understand what measurements are beneficial and why and the best way to implement projects that can take those measurements accurately. Alex was able to make the materials for the workshop free online!</p> <h5 id=\"alex-bramley\">Alex Bramley</h5> <p><a href=\"https://cre.page.link/art-of-slos-help\">Alex Bramley</a> joined Google in January 2010 as the first Mobile SRE in London, after IBM bought the <a href= \"https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-09-30-heroes-software-engineering-men-and-women-transitive\"> startup he enjoyed working for</a> and made it much less fun.

As a member of the Google SRE team, Alex and his coworkers help customers optimally run their services on Google Cloud. They collaborate with the client, weighing client needs and user needs to develop a plan that is affordable, efficient, and has the highest reliability for the user. Recently, they’ve been working to automate functions such as detection of outages, so that Google and the customer can work together quickly to get everything working smoothly again.</p> <p>Later, Alex, describes the steps developers go through at his workshop, The Art of SLOs, which was designed to help companies measure and improve reliability. At this workshop, attendees are encouraged to set SLO targets and error budgets. They are given theoretical reliability problems to solve, allowing them to practice without the added pressure of messy, real-world problems. The Art of SLOs helps developers understand what measurements are beneficial and why and the best way to implement projects that can take those measurements accurately. Alex was able to make the materials for the workshop free online!</p> Alex Bramley <p><a href=\"https://cre.page.link/art-of-slos-help\">Alex Bramley</a> joined Google in January 2010 as the first Mobile SRE in London, after IBM bought the <a href= \"https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-09-30-heroes-software-engineering-men-and-women-transitive\"> startup he enjoyed working for</a> and made it much less fun.

Amy starts the show by explaining that Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service that recently added Microsoft SQL Server to its repertoire. We talk about SQL Server’s migration from 2008R2 to a newer version, the process involved, and how it’s effecting customers. Luckily, Cloud SQL for SQL Server is very backwards compatible, making the process easy for Google Cloud customers! Cloud SQL also offers other tools to make using Microsoft SQL Server easier with Google Cloud, including shortcuts to set up the high availability function.</p> <p>Amy talks later in the show about what companies are a good fit for Microsoft SQL Servers on Google Cloud. She explains the steps to set up and tear down, how licensing works, and what the best use cases are for Microsoft SQL Servers on Google Cloud. In the future, Cloud SQL will have a managed AD service available.</p> <p>A multi-cloud strategy is important, according to Amy.

The program helps users manage their Google Cloud resources in a way that is familiar for Kubernetes developers. Emily explains that it’s a great tool for Kubernetes developers looking to easily manage their infrastructure in one place. A platform team managing other teams is a perfect example of large-scale companies who could benefit from this tool, Emily explains.</p> <p>Walking listeners through the development cycle before and after Kubernetes Config Connector, Emily shines some light on specific instances when this powerful tool could streamline the process of building your project, making it faster and more efficient. She elaborates on the ways Config Connector and Anthos can work together as well.</p> <p>In the future, the Config Connector team hopes to cover all GCP resources, to create a more clear end-to-end experience for Kubernetes developers, and to allow Config Connector to be enabled straight onto a cluster.</p> <h5 id=\"emily-cai\">Emily Cai</h5> <p>Emily is an engineer on Google Cloud’s Config Connector team focused on creating a declarative way for users to manage their non-Kubernetes resources. She has been with Google since November 2018 after interning twice (once in Irvine, once in Zurich).

Her team’s goal is to help developers escape scripting hell and smoothly enter the world of continuous delivery. In 2014 while studying she dove into Lithuania’s tech hub seeking to promote IT education nationwide. After finishing her studies she landed in Berlin’s tech scene and began working with 200+ dev teams across Europe analysing their processes and helping to improve workflows. During this period Domile became fascinated by the struggles that tech teams face working with cloud technologies. She envisioned building a product that helps developers optimize their workflows and reduce cognitive load. In 2018 she joined Humanitec in its early stages and currently she is working on an Internal Developer Platform which is pushing the industry to live in a “you-build-it, you-run-it” mindset.</p> <h5 id=\"chris-stephenson\">Chris Stephenson</h5> <p>Chris Stephenson is VP of Product at Humanitec. He has worked in Engineering or Product across industries as diverse as Waste Management, HR-tech and Insurance but in recent years has been focusing on building platforms that enable development teams to implement and quickly scale applications. This has included running the High Performance Computing Group at Lloyd’s of London focusing on designing and implementing a platform to allow Engineers and Actuaries to quickly iterate on internal models at Lloyd’s of London, building a platform to allow for very fast development of “Partner Front-End” applications at Google (think the partner facing admin interfaces for Google Transit search or managing inventory for Google Play Movies) and currently at Humanitec building an Internal Developer Platform that can be used by all engineering teams to speed up their development of Cloud Native Apps.</p> <h5 id=\"cool-things-of-the-week\">Cool things of the week</h5> <ul> <li>Showing the C++ developer love with new client libraries <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/new-cpp-client-libraries-available-for-google-cloud\"> blog</a></li> <li>New GCP Essentials video “GCP vs. Firebase — Part 1” <a href= \"https://medium.com/google-cloud/new-gcp-essentials-video-gcp-vs-firebase-part-1-f6a0c73f680a\"> blog</a> <ul> <li>GCPodcast Episode 180: Firebase with Jen Person <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-180-firebase-with-jen-person/\"> podcast</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Here to serve Korea’s businesses with a new GCP region in Seoul <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/infrastructure/new-gcp-region-in-seoul\"> blog</a></li> </ul> <h5 id=\"interview\">Interview</h5> <ul> <li>Humanitec <a href=\"https://humanitec.com/\">site</a></li> <li>CNCF <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io\">site</a></li> <li>GKE <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud SQL <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql/\">site</a></li> <li>Weaveworks <a href=\"https://www.weave.works\">site</a></li> <li>Harness <a href=\"https://harness.io\">site</a></li> </ul> <h5 id=\"question-of-the-week\">Question of the week</h5> <p><a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/overview\">How do you prevent exposing API keys in source code?</a></p> <h5 id=\"where-can-you-find-us-next\">Where can you find us next?</h5> <p>Mark will be traveling and working on a video series for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/googlecloudplatform\">Google Cloud YouTube Channel</a>.</p> <p>Jon will be at <a href=\"https://gdconf.com/\">GDC</a> in March.</p>",

First up, Zack explains some of the ways AutoML Vision and Video can be used to make life easier.

His goal is to inspire people to incorporate machine learning into their projects, so he tries to combine hardware and exciting technology to think of fun, creative ways developers can use ML. Recently, he made a smart AI bicycle that alerts riders of possible danger behind them through a system of lights and a project to track and photograph balls as they fly through the air after being kicked.</p> <p>To wrap it all up, Zack tells us about some cool projects he’s heard people use AutoML for (like bleeping out tv show spoilers in online videos!) and the future of the software.</p> <h5 id=\"zack-akil\">Zack Akil</h5> <p>When he’s not teaching machine learning at Google, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ZackAkil\">Zack</a> likes to teach machine learning at his hands-on data science meetup, Central London Data Science Project Nights.

This week, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/the_thagomizer\">Aja</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/briandorsey\">Brian</a> are talking DevOps with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nathenharvey\">Nathen Harvey</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jezhumble\">Jez Humble</a>. Our guests thoroughly explain what DevOps is and why it’s important. DevOps purposely has no official definition but can be thought of as a community of practice that aims to make large-scale systems reliable and secure. It’s also a way to get developers and operations to work together to focus on the needs of the customer.</p> <p>Nathen later tells us all about DevOpsDays, a series of locally organized conferences occurring in cities around the world. The main goal is to bring a cross-functional group of people together to talk about how they can improve IT, DevOps, business strategy, and consider cultural changes the organization might benefit from. DevOpsDays supports this by only planning content for half the conference, then turning over the other half to attendees via Open Spaces. At this time, conference-goers are welcome to propose a topic and start a conversation.</p> <p>Jez then describes the Accelerate State of DevOps Report, how it came to be, and why it’s so useful. It includes items like building security into the software, testing continuously, ideal management practices, product development practices, and more. With the help of the DevOps Quick Check, you can discover the places your company could use some help and then refer back to the report for suggestions of improvements in those areas.</p> <h5 id=\"nathen-harvey\">Nathen Harvey</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nathenharvey\">Nathen Harvey</a> helps the community understand and apply DevOps and SRE practices in the cloud.

Designed to provide serverless containers, Cloud Run has two versions: fully managed and Cloud Run for Anthos.</p> <p>Donna’s passion for serverless projects and containers shows as we discuss how these options benefit developers and customers. With containers, developers are able to go serverless without a lot of the typical restrictions, and because they are a standard format, containers are fairly easy to learn to use. Tools such as Ko can even do the work of generating docker containers for you. One of Cloud Run’s most unique features is that it allows developers to bring existing applications. You don’t have to rewrite your entire app to make it serverless! Developers can also reuse instances, making the process more efficient and cost effective.</p> <p>Cloud Run for Anthos allows projects to stay on-prem while still enjoying the benefits of containers and the Cloud Run platform.</p> <p>Later in the show, Donna tells us about Knative, which is the API Cloud Run is based on that helps create portability between Cloud Run versions, as well as portability to other vendors. We also get to hear the weirdest things she’s seen put in a container and run in Cloud Run!</p> <h5 id=\"donna-malayeri\">Donna Malayeri</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindydonna\">Donna Malayeri</a> is a product manager for Cloud Run for Anthos.

Designed to provide serverless containers, Cloud Run has two versions: fully managed and Cloud Run for Anthos.</p> <p>Donna’s passion for serverless projects and containers shows as we discuss how these options benefit developers and customers. With containers, developers are able to go serverless without a lot of the typical restrictions, and because they are a standard format, containers are fairly easy to learn to use. Tools such as Ko can even do the work of generating docker containers for you. One of Cloud Run’s most unique features is that it allows developers to bring existing applications. You don’t have to rewrite your entire app to make it serverless! Developers can also reuse instances, making the process more efficient and cost effective.</p> <p>Cloud Run for Anthos allows projects to stay on-prem while still enjoying the benefits of containers and the Cloud Run platform.</p> <p>Later in the show, Donna tells us about Knative, which is the API Cloud Run is based on that helps create portability between Cloud Run versions, as well as portability to other vendors. We also get to hear the weirdest things she’s seen put in a container and run in Cloud Run!</p> Donna Malayeri <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindydonna\">Donna Malayeri</a> is a product manager for Cloud Run for Anthos.

      "description": "<p>Happy Halloween! Today, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon Foust</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/briandorsey\">Brian Dorsey</a> chat with <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-laura-scuri-43270689/\">Maria Laura Scuri</a> of FACEIT about ways they are reducing toxicity in gaming. FACEIT is a competitive gaming platform that helps connect gamers and game competition and tournament organizers. In order to do this well, FACEIT has put a lot of energy into finding ways to keep the experience positive for everyone.</p> <p>Because gaming toxicity can involve anything from verbal jabs to throwing a game, FACEIT uses a combination of data collecting programs and input from players to help identify toxic behavior. In identifying this behavior, FACEIT has to consider not only the literal words spoken or actions made, but the context around them. Is that player being rude to strangers or is he egging on a friend? The answer to this question could change the behavior from unacceptable to friendly banter. Using their own machine learning model, interactions are then given a score to determine how toxic the player was in that match.</p> <p>The toxicity scores along with their program, Minerva, determine if any bans should be put on a player. FACEIT focuses on punishing player behavior, rather than the player themselves, in an effort to help players learn from the experience and change the way they interact with others in the future.</p> <p>Maria’s advice to other companies looking to help reduce toxicity on their platforms is to know the context of the toxic event. Know how toxicity can express itself on your platform and find ways to deal with all of them. She also suggests tackling the issues of toxicity in small portions and celebrating the small wins! Her final piece of advice is to focus on criticizing the behavior of the user rather than attacking them personally.</p> <h5 id=\"maria-laura-scuri\">Maria Laura Scuri</h5> <p><a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-laura-scuri-43270689/\">Maria</a> is the Director of Business Intelligence at FACEIT, the leading competitive platform for online multiplayer games with over 15 million users. She joined FACEIT as part of the core team in 2013 as an intern assisting with everything from customer support to event management. Her passion for data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence saw her quickly rise through the ranks to her current position, leading the Business Intelligence and Data Science teams.</p> <p>Maria works side by side with some of the biggest tech companies in the world including Google Cloud. She is the main lead on a number of projects including the inception of an Artificial Intelligence Admin to fight toxicity on the platform. Maria is responsible for implementing best practices around data visualization and tools that allow the FACEIT team to thrive, as well as sourcing and training new talent.</p> <p>Maria is a huge video games fan. You can find her on League of Legends as “FACEIT Lulu” and on Steam as “<a href= \"https://steamcommunity.com/id/sephariel89/\">Sephariel</a>”.</p> <h5 id=\"cool-things-of-the-week\">Cool things of the week</h5> <ul> <li>What can Google Cloud do for you?

      "content:encoded": "<p>Happy Halloween! Today, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon Foust</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/briandorsey\">Brian Dorsey</a> chat with <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-laura-scuri-43270689/\">Maria Laura Scuri</a> of FACEIT about ways they are reducing toxicity in gaming. FACEIT is a competitive gaming platform that helps connect gamers and game competition and tournament organizers. In order to do this well, FACEIT has put a lot of energy into finding ways to keep the experience positive for everyone.</p> <p>Because gaming toxicity can involve anything from verbal jabs to throwing a game, FACEIT uses a combination of data collecting programs and input from players to help identify toxic behavior. In identifying this behavior, FACEIT has to consider not only the literal words spoken or actions made, but the context around them. Is that player being rude to strangers or is he egging on a friend? The answer to this question could change the behavior from unacceptable to friendly banter. Using their own machine learning model, interactions are then given a score to determine how toxic the player was in that match.</p> <p>The toxicity scores along with their program, Minerva, determine if any bans should be put on a player. FACEIT focuses on punishing player behavior, rather than the player themselves, in an effort to help players learn from the experience and change the way they interact with others in the future.</p> <p>Maria’s advice to other companies looking to help reduce toxicity on their platforms is to know the context of the toxic event. Know how toxicity can express itself on your platform and find ways to deal with all of them. She also suggests tackling the issues of toxicity in small portions and celebrating the small wins! Her final piece of advice is to focus on criticizing the behavior of the user rather than attacking them personally.</p> Maria Laura Scuri <p><a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-laura-scuri-43270689/\">Maria</a> is the Director of Business Intelligence at FACEIT, the leading competitive platform for online multiplayer games with over 15 million users. She joined FACEIT as part of the core team in 2013 as an intern assisting with everything from customer support to event management. Her passion for data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence saw her quickly rise through the ranks to her current position, leading the Business Intelligence and Data Science teams.</p> <p>Maria works side by side with some of the biggest tech companies in the world including Google Cloud. She is the main lead on a number of projects including the inception of an Artificial Intelligence Admin to fight toxicity on the platform. Maria is responsible for implementing best practices around data visualization and tools that allow the FACEIT team to thrive, as well as sourcing and training new talent.</p> <p>Maria is a huge video games fan. You can find her on League of Legends as “FACEIT Lulu” and on Steam as “<a href= \"https://steamcommunity.com/id/sephariel89/\">Sephariel</a>”.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>What can Google Cloud do for you?

At SeMI Technologies, Laura works with their project Weaviate, an open-source knowledge graph program that allows users to do a contextualized search based on inputted data. However, unlike traditional databases, Weaviate attaches meanings and links within the data.</p> <p>Laura details what knowledge graphs are and how they can be useful for both small and large projects. Explaining that ontology is the meaning of words, she tells us how Weaviate is able to use this concept to make more specific data entries and links, allowing users to perform better and more informative searches. Weaviate is able to do this with the help of Kubernetes. Later, Laura tells Gabi and Jon the ways Weaviate helps developers and users with thorough documentation, assistance with troubleshooting, and support from solution engineers.</p> <h5 id=\"laura-ham\">Laura Ham</h5> <p>Laura is the Community Solution Engineer at SeMI Technologies, where she takes care of building and supporting a community around their open source software product, Weaviate. She also takes care of the developer and user experience within the business, which means she writes documentation to support both developers and users, as well as researches and evaluates new software implementations on user experience. She has a user-centered approach in the work that she develops and designs. Laura is a full-time graduate student in Human Computer Interaction and Design with a special focus on Innovation and Entrepreneurship at EIT Digital Master School.

Dale talks about natural language processing as well, explaining that it’s basically the intersection of machine learning and text processing. It can be used for anything from aggregating and sorting Twitter posts about your company to sentiment analysis.</p> <p>For developers looking to enter the machine learning space, Dale suggests starting with non life-threatening applications, such as labeling pictures. Next, consider the possible mistakes the application can make ahead of time to help mitigate issues.

Dale talks about natural language processing as well, explaining that it’s basically the intersection of machine learning and text processing. It can be used for anything from aggregating and sorting Twitter posts about your company to sentiment analysis.</p> <p>For developers looking to enter the machine learning space, Dale suggests starting with non life-threatening applications, such as labeling pictures. Next, consider the possible mistakes the application can make ahead of time to help mitigate issues.

Bigtable is Google’s petabyte scale, fully managed, NoSQL database. Billy elaborates on what projects Bigtable works best with, like time-series data user analytics, and why it’s such a great tool. It offers huge scalability with the benefits of a managed system, and it’s flexible and easily customized so users can turn on and off the pieces they need.</p> <p>Later, we learn about other programs that are compatible with Bigtable, such as JanusGraph, Open TSDB, and GeoMesa. Bigtable also supports the API for HBase, an open-source project similar to Bigtable. Because of this, it’s easy for HBase users to move to Bigtable, and the Bigtable community has access to many open source libraries. Billy also talks more about the nine clients available, and when customers might want to use Bigtable instead of, or in conjunction with, other Google services such as Spanner and BigQuery.</p> <h5 id=\"billy-jacobson\">Billy Jacobson</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/billyjacobson\">Billy Jacobson</a> is a developer programs engineer focusing on Cloud Bigtable.</p> <h5 id=\"cool-things-of-the-week\">Cool things of the week</h5> <ul> <li>Introducing Cloud Run Button: Click-to-deploy your git repos to Google Cloud <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/introducing-cloud-run-button-click-to-deploy-your-git-repos-to-google-cloud\"> blog</a></li> <li>Firebase Unity Solutions: Update game behavior without deploying with Remote Config <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gaming/firebase-unity-solutions-update-game-behavior-without-deploying-with-remote-config\"> blog</a></li> <li>Introducing the BigQuery Terraform module <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-the-bigquery-terraform-module\"> blog</a></li> <li>Macy’s uses Google Cloud to streamline retail operations <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/customers/macys-uses-google-cloud-to-streamline-retail-operations\"> blog</a></li> </ul> <h5 id=\"interview\">Interview</h5> <ul> <li>Cloud Bigtable <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/\">site</a></li> <li>GCP Podcast Episode 18: Bigtable with Ian Lewis <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-18-bigtable-with-ian-lewis/\"> podcast</a></li> <li>BigQuery <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/\">site</a></li> <li>Bigtable Documentation <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/\">docs</a></li> <li>Codelab: Introduction to Cloud Bigtable <a href= \"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-bigtable-intro-java/index.html#0\"> site</a></li> <li>Key Visualizer <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/keyvis-overview\">docs</a></li> <li>Bigtable Replication Documentation <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/replication-overview\">docs</a></li> <li>Bigtable and HBase Documentation <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/hbase-bigtable\">docs</a></li> <li>HBase <a href=\"https://hbase.apache.org\">site</a></li> <li>JanusGraph <a href=\"https://janusgraph.org\">site</a></li> <li>Open TSDB <a href=\"http://opentsdb.net\">site</a></li> <li>GeoMesa <a href=\"https://www.geomesa.org\">site</a></li> <li>Bigtable Client Libraries <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/reference/libraries\">docs</a></li> <li>Cloud Spanner <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/spanner\">site</a></li> <li>Managing IoT Storage with Google’s Cloud Platform (Google I/O’19) <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j1BVZOMqWU\">video</a></li> <li>Cloud Datastore <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/datastore/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Firestore <a href= \"https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore\">site</a></li> <li>Mapping the invisible: Street View cars add air pollution sensors <a href= \"https://sustainability.google/projects/airview/\">site</a></li> <li>Breathing Easy with Bigtable <a href= \"https://medium.com/google-cloud/breathing-easy-with-bigtable-b58eb302cc1a\"> article</a></li> </ul> <h5 id=\"question-of-the-week\">Question of the week</h5> <p><a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/analyzing-gcp-costs-using-folders-and-bigquery-billing-export\"> If I have an organization, how do I break down my billing data by folder?</a></p> <h5 id=\"where-can-you-find-us-next\">Where can you find us next?</h5> <p>Mark Mirch is working around town but will be headed to LA soon.</p> <p>Mark Mandel will be at <a href=\"https://dev.paxsite.com\">Pax Dev</a>, <a href=\"https://west.paxsite.com\">Pax West</a>, <a href= \"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/\"> Kubecon</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.gdconf.com\">GDC Online Games Technology Summit</a>.</p>",

Bigtable is Google’s petabyte scale, fully managed, NoSQL database. Billy elaborates on what projects Bigtable works best with, like time-series data user analytics, and why it’s such a great tool. It offers huge scalability with the benefits of a managed system, and it’s flexible and easily customized so users can turn on and off the pieces they need.</p> <p>Later, we learn about other programs that are compatible with Bigtable, such as JanusGraph, Open TSDB, and GeoMesa.

Our guests, Ron Hicks and Austin Adams, describe how this idea came about, the mechanics of the system, and how it could change the world of livestock.</p> <p>HerdX is an environmentally friendly, humane way to improve the system of livestock management and sales. It uses monitoring systems to follow animals as they move about the field, then employs algorithms to identify any problems that may need attention. This allows for treatment of specific animals, rather than mass treatment of both healthy and unhealthy livestock. When pitted against humans, HerdX’s AI system could pinpoint the problem livestock much faster and more accurately than people. Once problem livestock are found, the rancher can use that information to devise and implement a treatment plan. Consumers benefit from HerdX as well, through better quality meat and better transparency of rancher practices. The players in the supply chain are recorded and meat is monitored through the entire process, from farm, to feed lot, to the dinner table. Because bad animals can be removed or cured and the supply chain is run much more efficiently, meat spoilage and food poisoning can be mitigated.</p> <h5 id=\"ron-hicks\">Ron Hicks</h5> <p>As the CEO & Founder of HerdX, Inc., a global AgTech company based in the Texas Hill Country, Ron is filling the void in ag data with IoT devices designed for livestock herds. In a nutshell, HerdX is using tags, water, and data to connect farmers around the world with families around the dinner table. Before his time with HerdX, Ron had a number of immensely successful career paths and achievements as a serial entrepreneur, inventor, and a strong visionary who loves disruptive technologies that can change the world. He was distinguished with Business Week’s top industrial design award in Medical Technologies, which recognized him along with other leaders and companies throughout the world, including BMW, Sony, Logitech, and Ford Motor Company. Ron is also a dynamic speaker who is passionate about solving problems rather than just talking about them and has spoken at conferences as a keynote speaker at Google headquarters in the United States and Singapore.

Developers are asked coding questions and allowed to work in sandbox environments to fully expose them to the subject. Instruqt checks the student’s work as they continue through the program to ensure the material is being properly learned.</p> <p>But learning should be fun, too! By putting developer challenges on old-style arcade machines, developers can test their coding skills, learn new things, and have fun at the same time. At conferences, this has been a great way to engage their target audience. Google Cloud games were run on the Instruqt platform at Next ‘19, and conference attendees came back day after day to try to get on the high score leaderboard. It was a super fun way to get people using Google Cloud technologies!</p> <h5 id=\"adé-mochtar\">Adé Mochtar</h5> <p>Adé is Co-Founder and CTO of Instruqt, a hands-on learning platform for IT technology.

Developers are asked coding questions and allowed to work in sandbox environments to fully expose them to the subject. Instruqt checks the student’s work as they continue through the program to ensure the material is being properly learned.</p> <p>But learning should be fun, too! By putting developer challenges on old-style arcade machines, developers can test their coding skills, learn new things, and have fun at the same time. At conferences, this has been a great way to engage their target audience. Google Cloud games were run on the Instruqt platform at Next ‘19, and conference attendees came back day after day to try to get on the high score leaderboard. It was a super fun way to get people using Google Cloud technologies!</p> Adé Mochtar <p>Adé is Co-Founder and CTO of Instruqt, a hands-on learning platform for IT technology.

      "description": "<p>This week on the podcast, Yuri Litvinovich of Scotiabank was able to join <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/texasmichelle\">Michelle Casbon</a> to talk about migration from on-prem and their partnership with Google Cloud. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark Mandel</a> stops in with some cool things of the week and the question of the week, too!</p> <p>With Yuri’s help, Scotiabank is working to become a modern financial services technology company. Their transition from working mostly on-prem to working in the cloud was exciting for him as he discovered how much cheaper, faster, and more secure large enterprise projects can be in the public cloud. Three years ago, Scotiabank’s CEO began encouraging this shift to keep the company up-to-date, with funds allocated to moving all their thousands of applications and products to a more efficient system.</p> <p>To accomplish this, Yuri turned to Kubernetes to make use of containers. Because they are light and homogenous in different environments, the modernization at Scotiabank went much more smoothly with Kubernetes and GKE. They also use a mix of managed systems like BigQuery, Dataflow, and Pub/Sub, as well as made-from-scratch applications that help the Google products to be compatible with Scotiabank’s existing software.

Their transition from working mostly on-prem to working in the cloud was exciting for him as he discovered how much cheaper, faster, and more secure large enterprise projects can be in the public cloud. Three years ago, Scotiabank’s CEO began encouraging this shift to keep the company up-to-date, with funds allocated to moving all their thousands of applications and products to a more efficient system.</p> <p>To accomplish this, Yuri turned to Kubernetes to make use of containers. Because they are light and homogenous in different environments, the modernization at Scotiabank went much more smoothly with Kubernetes and GKE. They also use a mix of managed systems like BigQuery, Dataflow, and Pub/Sub, as well as made-from-scratch applications that help the Google products to be compatible with Scotiabank’s existing software.

      "description": "<p>On this episode, our hosts <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/gabidavila\">Gabi Ferrara</a> dive into Google Cloud Platform UX with guest and Google Product Designer <a href= \"https://twitter.com/m_kleinerman\">Michael Kleinerman</a>. Michael’s path to Product Designer started with “ancient” tech designing with Flash and 3D motion graphics and progressed from there through interaction designer to his place now with Google. His experience has helped him appreciate the many different kinds of designers needed for projects and how they have to work together for a good product.</p> <p>At Google, Michael’s team builds design systems that create a balance between what Google uses and what the products built on Google use. He adopted Material Design, which offers guidelines for patterns and components of design, to Google Cloud. Material Design spans across multiple devices and screen sizes to help simplify design across devices. When Cloud reached the enterprise space, where components can be more complex, Michael’s team worked to adjust Cloud using Material Design so that features like tables would work correctly.</p> <p>Accessibility is also a top priority for Cloud and the design team. To begin the process of designing for accessibility, the team finds the top three or so reasons that a user would come to their product and ensures those are accessible to all.

      "content:encoded": "<p>On this episode, our hosts <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/gabidavila\">Gabi Ferrara</a> dive into Google Cloud Platform UX with guest and Google Product Designer <a href= \"https://twitter.com/m_kleinerman\">Michael Kleinerman</a>. Michael’s path to Product Designer started with “ancient” tech designing with Flash and 3D motion graphics and progressed from there through interaction designer to his place now with Google. His experience has helped him appreciate the many different kinds of designers needed for projects and how they have to work together for a good product.</p> <p>At Google, Michael’s team builds design systems that create a balance between what Google uses and what the products built on Google use. He adopted Material Design, which offers guidelines for patterns and components of design, to Google Cloud. Material Design spans across multiple devices and screen sizes to help simplify design across devices. When Cloud reached the enterprise space, where components can be more complex, Michael’s team worked to adjust Cloud using Material Design so that features like tables would work correctly.</p> <p>Accessibility is also a top priority for Cloud and the design team. To begin the process of designing for accessibility, the team finds the top three or so reasons that a user would come to their product and ensures those are accessible to all. The next step is to create easier usability in the second tier features of the product, and then all features beyond. Using a screen reader, they go through the product to see if it’s usable, and really try to make the experience better. The team also makes sure there are a lot of guidance pages as well.</p> <p>The goal in product design is to make things simple and consistent for everyone.</p> Michael Kleinerman <p>Michael is a Product Designer at Google.

Michelle and special guest Amanda were able to catch up with Paco Nathan of Derwen AI to talk about his experience at Next and learn what Derwen is doing to advance AI.</p> <p>Paco and Derwen have been working extensively on ways developer relations can be enhanced by machine learning. Along with O’Reilly Media, Derwen just completed three surveys, called ABC (AI, Big Data, and Cloud), to look at the adoption of AI and the cloud around the world. The particular interest in these studies is a comparison between countries who have been using AI, Big Data, and Cloud for years and countries who are just beginning to get involved. One of the most interesting things they learned is how much budget companies are allocating to machine learning projects. They also noticed that more and more large enterprises are moving, at least partially, to the cloud.</p> <p>One of the challenges Paco noticed was the difference between machine learning projects in testing versus how they act once they go live. Here, developers come across bias, ethical, and safety issues. Good data governance polices can help minimize these problems. Developing good data governance policies is complex, especially with security issues, but it’s an important conversation to have. In the process of computing the survey data, Paco discovered many big companies spend a lot of time with this issue and even employ checklists of requirements before projects can be made live.</p> <p>In his research, Paco also discovered that about 54% of companies are non-starters. Usually, their problems stem from tech debt and issues with company personnel who do not recognize the need for machine learning. The companies working toward integrating machine learning tend to have issues finding good staff. Berkeley is working to solve this problem by requiring data science classes of all students. But as Paco says, data science is a team sport that works well with a team of people from different disciplines. Paco is an advocate of mentoring, to help the next generation of data scientists learn and grow, and of unbundling corporate decision making to help advance AI.</p> <p>Amanda, Michelle, and Paco wrap up their discussion with a look toward how to change ML biases. People tend to blame ML for bias outcomes, but models are subject to data we feed in. Humans have to make decisions to work around that by looking at things from a different perspective and taking steps to avoid as much bias as we can. ML and humans can work together to find these biases and help remove them.</p> <h5 id=\"paco-nathan\">Paco Nathan</h5> <p>Paco Nathan is the Managing Parter at Derwen.

      "description": "<p>Your favorite Marks <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mirchandani</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mandel</a> are back hosting this week to touch base with <a href= \"https://twitter.com/wangela\">Angela Yu</a> about recent updates in Google Maps. As Angela describes Google Maps at a high level, it is your window into the real world, with coverage of Earth’s land and oceans. Google works hard to keep that information updated with satellite pictures, street view Google vehicles, and even backpacks for hikers to record hard to reach areas.</p> <p>The Google Maps API makes it easy for developers to use Maps data in their own projects. It can be used for something as simple as showing location to something more complicated, for example showing the user specific things around them to help them make decisions. Game developers can create rich experiences by building real-world gaming situations with Maps and augmented reality. Using the Places API can display parks, government buildings, and other interesting places beyond streets. And the Routes API can expand the user experience by providing directions, tracking drivers in real time, etc. Maps and Google Cloud together work well with BigQuery to search huge amounts of data and visualize them on a map.</p> <p>In the future, Angela is particularly excited about how ridesharing apps will continue to use Maps and Routes to optimize their businesses.

      "content:encoded": "<p>Your favorite Marks <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mirchandani</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mandel</a> are back hosting this week to touch base with <a href= \"https://twitter.com/wangela\">Angela Yu</a> about recent updates in Google Maps. As Angela describes Google Maps at a high level, it is your window into the real world, with coverage of Earth’s land and oceans. Google works hard to keep that information updated with satellite pictures, street view Google vehicles, and even backpacks for hikers to record hard to reach areas.</p> <p>The Google Maps API makes it easy for developers to use Maps data in their own projects. It can be used for something as simple as showing location to something more complicated, for example showing the user specific things around them to help them make decisions. Game developers can create rich experiences by building real-world gaming situations with Maps and augmented reality. Using the Places API can display parks, government buildings, and other interesting places beyond streets. And the Routes API can expand the user experience by providing directions, tracking drivers in real time, etc. Maps and Google Cloud together work well with BigQuery to search huge amounts of data and visualize them on a map.</p> <p>In the future, Angela is particularly excited about how ridesharing apps will continue to use Maps and Routes to optimize their businesses. She also looks forward to more augmented reality projects beyond gaming, where data, directions, and more are overlaid on the physical world.</p> Angela Yu <p>Angela Yu is a developer advocate for Google Maps Platform.

Firebase is a suite of products that helps developers build apps. According to Jen, it’s equivalent to the client-side of Google Cloud.

It helps site and app owners interact with and reach customers with services like notifications, remote configurations to optimize the app, testing, and more.</p> <p>Cloud Firestore has come out of beta, and it is available both through Firebase and Google Cloud Platform, making it easy for developers to move from one to the other if their needs change.</p> <p>Recently, the Firebase team has been working to refine their products based on user feedback. Firebase Authentication has been upgraded with the additions of phone authentication, email link authentication, and multiple email actions. They’ve also added a generic authentication option so developers can use any provider they choose.</p> <p>ML Kit makes machine learning much easier for client apps or on the server. With on-device ML features, users can continue using the app without internet service. Things like face recognition can still be done quickly without a wifi connection. ML Kit is adding new features all the time, including smart reply and translation, image labeling , facial feature detection, etc.</p> <p>Cloud Functions for Firebase is also out of beta. It includes new features like a crash-litics trigger that can notify you if your site or app crashes and scheduled functions.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon Foust</a> is back this week, joining <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark Mirchandani</a> for an in-depth look at <a href= \"https://twitter.com/stackdriver\">Stackdriver</a> with fellow Googler, Rory Petty. To start, Product Manager Rory explains that Stackdriver is a full observability solution for Google Cloud (as well as other clouds). We touch on how monitoring, logging, and APM tools allow developers and operators to fully understand how a website is performing. In addition to Monitoring and Logging, the suite of Stackdriver tools also includes Debugger, Trace, and Profiler to help users not only monitor their sites, but to solve problems that occur.</p> <p>Stackdriver Monitoring and Logging support Google Cloud services out of the box. Users can use Monitoring to set up alerts, so if something goes awry, they are notified immediately and can address the problem. Alerts can also be custom designed to inform developers of things like number of checkouts on your e-commerce site, the amount of time between checkouts, and more. Stackdriver Monitoring allows blackbox monitoring, too, to make sure your service is healthy. The Monitoring dashboard makes it really easy to get started, with a resources section that has pre-made dashboards for developers to use. Developers don’t have to do a lot of configuration out of the box. However, if you need a more customized dashboard, that is also possible in Stackdriver Monitoring.</p> <p>At Cloud Next earlier this year, Stackdriver announced Service Monitoring in alpha, which shows users a map of their microservices architecture. Public beta will hopefully be later this year. Stackdriver Sandbox, another recent project currently in the alpha stage, gives people an easy way to configure a test Stackdriver environment. This way, developers can play with Stackdriver tools without effecting their websites. Stackdriver Profiler, a great tool to understand the performance of your system, went GA at Cloud Next as well.</p> <p>Stackdriver’s tools are all meant to work together to help you maintain and perfect development projects on many different cloud services and on-prem.</p> <h5 id=\"rory-petty\">Rory Petty</h5> <p>Rory Petty is Product Manager for the Stackdriver Monitoring Platform.

      "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/texasmichelle\">Michelle</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markmirch\">Mark</a> are together again this week to talk with John Bohannon about AI startup, Primer. His goal is to build systems that continuously read documents and write about what they discover. He discusses his recent work building a self-updating knowledge base and the research his team just published.</p> <p>Perhaps most interesting is the circuitous path he took to get to Primer. Hear about his adventures along the way to becoming a data scientist specializing in natural language processing. How does a microbiologist who developed a pregnancy test for fish get distracted by Python? What does contemporary dance have to do with establishing AI policy? Join us as he weaves a common thread along his career path: encountering interesting problems and discovering creative ways to solve them.</p> <h5 id=\"john-bohannon\">John Bohannon</h5> <p>John Bohannon is the Director of Science at Primer, an AI startup in San Francisco. Until 2017 he was an investigative journalist and data scientist writing mainly for Science magazine and Wired. He spent the first half of his career as a foreign correspondent, including as a Fulbright scholar in Berlin. His reporting from Gaza won the Reuters-IUCN Media Award for Excellence in Environmental Reporting from Europe. While embedded with military forces in Afghanistan he engineered the first voluntary release of civilian casualty data by NATO and the United Nations.

His goal is to build systems that continuously read documents and write about what they discover. He discusses his recent work building a self-updating knowledge base and the research his team just published.</p> <p>Perhaps most interesting is the circuitous path he took to get to Primer. Hear about his adventures along the way to becoming a data scientist specializing in natural language processing. How does a microbiologist who developed a pregnancy test for fish get distracted by Python? What does contemporary dance have to do with establishing AI policy? Join us as he weaves a common thread along his career path: encountering interesting problems and discovering creative ways to solve them.</p> John Bohannon <p>John Bohannon is the Director of Science at Primer, an AI startup in San Francisco. Until 2017 he was an investigative journalist and data scientist writing mainly for Science magazine and Wired. He spent the first half of his career as a foreign correspondent, including as a Fulbright scholar in Berlin. His reporting from Gaza won the Reuters-IUCN Media Award for Excellence in Environmental Reporting from Europe. While embedded with military forces in Afghanistan he engineered the first voluntary release of civilian casualty data by NATO and the United Nations. As a visiting scholar in the Program in Ethics and Health at Harvard University he focused on the involvement of doctors and social scientists in the US government’s torture program. He was also the scientific advisor to Isabella Rosselini for “Green Porno” (winner of 4 Webby awards) and “Animals Distract Me” (official selection, 2011 Sundance Film Festival).

      "description": "<p>Today on the podcast, we speak with <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ia_buck\">Ian Buck</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/karibriski\">Kari Briski</a> of NVIDIA about new updates and achievements in deep learning. Ian begins by telling hosts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> about his first project at NVIDIA, CUDA, and how it has helped expand and pave the way for future projects in super computing, AI, and gaming. CUDA is used extensively in computer vision, speech and audio applications, and machine comprehension, Kari elaborates.</p> <p>NVIDIA recently announced their new Tensor Cores, which maximize their GPUs and make it easier for users to achieve peak performance. Working with the Tensor Cores, TensorFlow AMP is an acceleration into the TensorFlow Framework. It automatically makes the right choices for neural networks and maximizes performance, while still maintaining accuracy, with only a two line change in Tensor Flow script.</p> <p>Just last year, NVIDIA announced their T4 GPU with Google Cloud Platform. This product is designed for inferences, the other side of AI. Because AI is becoming so advanced, complicated, and fast, the GPUs on the inference side have to be able to handle the workload and produce inferences just as quickly. T4 and Google Cloud accomplish this together. Along with T4, NVIDIA has introduced TensorRT, a software framework for AI inference that’s integrated into TensorFlow.</p> <h5 id=\"ian-buck\">Ian Buck</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ia_buck\">Ian Buck</a> is general manager and vice president of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. He is responsible for the company’s worldwide datacenter business, including server GPUs and the enabling NVIDIA computing software for AI and HPC used by millions of developers, researchers and scientists. Buck joined NVIDIA in 2004 after completing his PhD in computer science from Stanford University, where he was development lead for Brook, the forerunner to generalized computing on GPUs. He is also the creator of CUDA, which has become the world’s leading platform for accelerated parallel computing. Buck has testified before the U.S. Congress on artificial intelligence and has advised the White House on the topic.

      "content:encoded": "<p>Today on the podcast, we speak with <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ia_buck\">Ian Buck</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/karibriski\">Kari Briski</a> of NVIDIA about new updates and achievements in deep learning. Ian begins by telling hosts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/syntxerror1\">Jon</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> about his first project at NVIDIA, CUDA, and how it has helped expand and pave the way for future projects in super computing, AI, and gaming. CUDA is used extensively in computer vision, speech and audio applications, and machine comprehension, Kari elaborates.</p> <p>NVIDIA recently announced their new Tensor Cores, which maximize their GPUs and make it easier for users to achieve peak performance. Working with the Tensor Cores, TensorFlow AMP is an acceleration into the TensorFlow Framework. It automatically makes the right choices for neural networks and maximizes performance, while still maintaining accuracy, with only a two line change in Tensor Flow script.</p> <p>Just last year, NVIDIA announced their T4 GPU with Google Cloud Platform. This product is designed for inferences, the other side of AI. Because AI is becoming so advanced, complicated, and fast, the GPUs on the inference side have to be able to handle the workload and produce inferences just as quickly. T4 and Google Cloud accomplish this together. Along with T4, NVIDIA has introduced TensorRT, a software framework for AI inference that’s integrated into TensorFlow.</p> Ian Buck <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ia_buck\">Ian Buck</a> is general manager and vice president of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. He is responsible for the company’s worldwide datacenter business, including server GPUs and the enabling NVIDIA computing software for AI and HPC used by millions of developers, researchers and scientists. Buck joined NVIDIA in 2004 after completing his PhD in computer science from Stanford University, where he was development lead for Brook, the forerunner to generalized computing on GPUs. He is also the creator of CUDA, which has become the world’s leading platform for accelerated parallel computing. Buck has testified before the U.S. Congress on artificial intelligence and has advised the White House on the topic. Buck also received a BSE degree in computer science from Princeton University.</p> Kari Briski <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/karibriski\">Kari Briski</a> is a Senior Director of Accelerated Computing Software Product Management at NVIDIA.

It is capable of handling large transactions very quickly and with great flexibility. With HANA, you don’t move data around, so you can run transaction workloads, as well as analytics, etc. in the same platform.</p> <p>By teaming up with GCP, SAP HANA ensures that their enterprise users will have scalability and storage no matter how their businesses grow. GCP and SAP HANA developers have been working together to continue to make the products better.</p> Lucia Subatin <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LuciaBlick\">Lucia</a>, Developer Advocate for SAP, is a proud geek.

In her time with Google Cloud, she and her team have worked to uncover what makes developers more productive. The main focus of their work is DevOps, defined by Melody as automation around the developer workflow and culture. In other words, Melody and her team are discovering new ways for developers to interact and how those interactions can encourage their productive peak.</p> <p>Melody and her team have used their internal research and expanded it to collaborate with Google Cloud partners and open source projects. The sharing of research and products has created even faster innovation as Google learns from these outside projects and vice versa.</p> <p>In the future, Melody sees amazing engagement with the community and even better experiences with containers on GCP. She is excited to see the Go community growing and evolving as more people use it and give feedback. Melody also speaks about diversity, encouraging everyone to be open-minded and try to build diverse teams to create products that are useful for all.</p> <h5 id=\"melody-meckfessel\">Melody Meckfessel</h5> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmeckf\">Melody Meckfessel</a> is a hands-on technology leader with more than 20 years experience building and maintaining large-scale distributed systems and solving problems at scale. As VP of Engineering, she leads the team building DevOps tools and sharing DevOps best practices across Google and with software development and operations teams around the world.

We touch on tensors, their use, and how they relate to TensorFlow. Anima also details the work she does with NVIDIA and how they are helping to advance machine learning through hardware and software. Our main discussion centers around AI and machine learning research conferences, specifically the Neural Information Processing Systems conference (commonly referred to as NIPS) and the reason they have rebranded.</p> <p>NIPS originally started as a small conference at Caltech. As deep learning became more and more popular, it grew exponentially. With the higher attendance and interest, the acronym became center stage.

At first, conference organizers were reluctant to rebrand and they used recent survey results as a reason to keep NIPS.</p> <p>Anima discusses her personal experience protesting the acronym, opening up about the hate speech and threats of which she and others received. Despite the harassment, Anima and others continued to protest, petition, and share stories of mistreatment within the community which helped lead to the name/acronym change to NeurIPS.

KF gives her perspective on Strange Loop, working remotely, and distributed systems. She compliments Strange Loop for the diversity it has achieved as the conference has grown. She laments the lack of introductory material for distributed systems learners, saying it’s not as complicated as everyone thinks but needs more educational material for beginners! In general, she believes everyone could benefit from some code study, especially if you can find a good mentor. KF also gives us some great tips for working remotely and staying effective and social.</p> Katherine Fellows <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kf\">KF</a> is a senior engineer focusing on backend, infrastructure, and data engineering.

      "description": "<p>In our last (but not least!) interview from NEXT, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/nyghtowl\">Melanie</a> talked with Sivan Aldor-Noiman and Erik Andrejko about <a href= \"https://twitter.com/getwellio\">Wellio</a>, an awesome new platform that combines AI and healthy eating. Wellio was developed as a way to not only educate users on the importance of proper nutrition for well-being but to give them their own personal nutritionist.</p> <p>The data scientists at Wellio started from scratch (pun intended) to create their own food-related database and then began training models so the data could be organized and personalized. Using a combination of human power and machine learning techniques, Wellio learns your preferences, allergies, diets, etc. and will make healthy decisions for you based on these key facts. It chooses recipes, populates a grocery list, and even has the ingredients delivered to your door in time for dinner!</p> <h5 id=\"sivan-aldor-noiman\">Sivan Aldor-Noiman</h5> <p>Sivan heads Data Science for Wellio, an early stage startup in the FoodTech space that is helping people eat better. In Wellio, her team delivers models that help inspire, empower and adapt to people’s eating needs, cooking abilities and health constraints. She began her career in the Israeli military serving as an instructor for an anti-tank missile unit (please don’t think Rambo, think more like a classroom teacher). Sivan then transitioned to school and received her undergraduate degree in Industrial Engineering and a Master in Statistics from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. She moved to the U.S. to complete a Ph.D. degree in Statistics from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. In her previous job, Sivan ended up leading several Data Science teams and learned that she really liked leading technical people since she got to learn a lot from them. Ultimately, she missed the smaller company mentality, so she is back in the startup world. Sivan was once asked to define herself so here goes: “I am an enthusiastic disagreeable giver and a constant empirical driven learner”.</p> <h5 id=\"erik-andrejko\">Erik Andrejko</h5> <p>Erik has spent his career making a positive impact on the world through mathematics.

      "content:encoded": "<p>In our last (but not least!) interview from NEXT, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/nyghtowl\">Melanie</a> talked with Sivan Aldor-Noiman and Erik Andrejko about <a href= \"https://twitter.com/getwellio\">Wellio</a>, an awesome new platform that combines AI and healthy eating. Wellio was developed as a way to not only educate users on the importance of proper nutrition for well-being but to give them their own personal nutritionist.</p> <p>The data scientists at Wellio started from scratch (pun intended) to create their own food-related database and then began training models so the data could be organized and personalized. Using a combination of human power and machine learning techniques, Wellio learns your preferences, allergies, diets, etc. and will make healthy decisions for you based on these key facts. It chooses recipes, populates a grocery list, and even has the ingredients delivered to your door in time for dinner!</p> Sivan Aldor-Noiman <p>Sivan heads Data Science for Wellio, an early stage startup in the FoodTech space that is helping people eat better. In Wellio, her team delivers models that help inspire, empower and adapt to people’s eating needs, cooking abilities and health constraints. She began her career in the Israeli military serving as an instructor for an anti-tank missile unit (please don’t think Rambo, think more like a classroom teacher). Sivan then transitioned to school and received her undergraduate degree in Industrial Engineering and a Master in Statistics from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. She moved to the U.S. to complete a Ph.D. degree in Statistics from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. In her previous job, Sivan ended up leading several Data Science teams and learned that she really liked leading technical people since she got to learn a lot from them. Ultimately, she missed the smaller company mentality, so she is back in the startup world. Sivan was once asked to define herself so here goes: “I am an enthusiastic disagreeable giver and a constant empirical driven learner”.</p> Erik Andrejko <p>Erik has spent his career making a positive impact on the world through mathematics. He is a co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Wellio - an early stage startup applying AI to the intersection of food and human health. Previously, Erik lead the data science and research organization at The Climate Corporation, which applies data science to solve challenging problems in numerous domains including climatology, agronomic modeling and geospatial applications. When not analyzing interesting datasets, Erik can often be found riding up some incline on a bicycle or cooking.</p> Cool things of the week <ul> <li>Summary of Google Cloud Next Tokyo <a href= \"https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next18/tokyo\">site</a></li> <li>Deep Learning Indaba GCP Credit Awards <a href= \"https://twitter.com/DeepIndaba/status/1040561702910263297\">site</a></li> <li>Data Studio and Dataprep are now generally available <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/unlock-insights-with-ease-data-studio-and-cloud-dataprep-are-now-generally-available\"> blog</a> <ul> <li>DS: BI analyze <a href= \"https://datastudio.google.com/data\">more than 500 other data sources</a> via more than 100 partner-built connectors and used by over a million people globally</li> <li>DP: new look, team collab and more analytics features <a href= \"https://www.trifacta.com/blog/announcing-general-availability-google-cloud-dataprep-trifacta/\"> blog</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Announcing general availability of Cloud Memorystore for Redis <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/announcing-general-availability-of-cloud-memorystore-for-redis\"> blog</a></li> <li>Coursera Advanced Machine Learning with TensorFlow with GCP <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/training-certifications/now-on-coursera-advanced-machine-learning-with-tensorflow-on-google-cloud-platform\"> blog</a> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/americas\">Webinar</a> on October 9th at 9AM PST to learn more</li> </ul> </li> <li>Simplifying ML predictions with Google Cloud Functions <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/simplifying-ml-predictions-with-google-cloud-functions\"> blog</a></li> <li>50 Best Cloud Security Podcasts <a href= \"https://securityboulevard.com/2018/09/50-best-cloud-security-podcasts/\"> site</a> <ul> <li>GCP Podcast Episode #100: Vint Cerf: past, present, and future of the internet <a href= \"https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-100-vint-cerf/\">podcast</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> Interview <ul> <li>Wellio <a href=\"http://www.getwellio.com/\">site</a></li> <li>GKE <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Storage <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/storage/\">site</a></li> <li>Pub/Sub <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Composer <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/composer/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud ML Engine <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/\">site</a></li> <li>Stackdriver <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Functions <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/functions/\">site</a></li> <li>TensorFlow <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org\">site</a></li> <li>Keras <a href=\"https://keras.io\">site</a></li> <li>Scikit Learn <a href= \"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud TPU <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud AutoML <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/automl/\">site</a></li> <li>Cloud Vision <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/vision/\">site</a></li> <li>DevOps201 for Application Developers <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzE-zNX67w0&list=PLBgogxgQVM9v0xG0QTFQ5PTbNrj8uGSS-&index=221&t=0s\"> video</a></li> <li>Cloud Firestore <a href= \"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/\">site</a></li> <li>Day 3 Keynote: Made Here Together <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQPOPV_VH5w&index=337&t=0s&list=PLBgogxgQVM9v0xG0QTFQ5PTbNrj8uGSS-\"> video</a></li> <li>Spinnaker <a href=\"https://www.spinnaker.io\">site</a></li> <li>Contact Wellio <a href= \"mailto:%20sivan@getwellio.com\">email</a></li> </ul> Questions of the week <p>Is Inbox going away?</p> <ul> <li>Inbox is signing off: find your favorite features in the new Gmail <a href= \"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/inbox-signing-find-your-favorite-features-new-gmail/\"> blog</a></li> <li>5 ways the new Gmail can help you get more done <a href= \"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/5-ways-new-gmail-can-help-you-get-more-done/\"> blog</a></li> </ul> Where can you find us next? <p>We’ll both be at <a href= \"https://www.thestrangeloop.com\">Strangeloop</a>.</p> <p>Mark will probably be at <a href= \"https://unite.unity.com/2018/los-angeles\">Unite L.A.</a> in October.</p> <p>Melanie speaking at <a href= \"https://monktoberfest.com/\">Monktoberfest</a> Oct 4th in Portland, Maine.</p>",

Bottom line - we need one solution that works for all.</p> <h5 id=\"haben-girma\">Haben Girma</h5> <p>The first Deafblind person to graduate from Harvard Law School, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HabenGirma\">Haben Girma</a> advocates for equal opportunities for people with disabilities. President Obama named her a White House Champion of Change, and Forbes recognized her in Forbes 30 Under 30. Haben travels the world consulting and public speaking, teaching clients the benefits of fully accessible products and services. Haben is a talented storyteller who helps people frame difference as an asset. She resisted society’s low expectations, choosing to create her own pioneering story.

Post-quantum cryptography is about developing algorithms that are resistant to quantum computers in conjunction with “classical” computers. It’s about looking at the full picture of potential threats and planning on how to address them using a diversity of types of mathematics in the research. Adam and Nick help clarify the different terminology and techniques that are applied in the research and give a practical understanding of what to expect from a security perspective.</p> Nick Sullivan

They’re powered by Google Cloud Platform, and their CEO, <a href= \"https://twitter.com/craiganssle\">Craig Ganssle</a>, is here to tell <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Neurotic\">Mark</a> and <a href= \"https://twitter.com/francesc\">Francesc</a> all about it.</p> <h5 id=\"about-craig-ganssle\">About Craig Ganssle</h5> <p>Craig Ganssle is the Founder and CEO of Basecamp Networks. With over 20 years in the technology industry, Craig has extensive experience developing and deploying wireless networks and designing predictive learning solutions for complex problem solving.</p> <p>Craig started Basecamp Networks in 2007 providing global wireless network infrastructures as well as creative solutions for difficult and time-consuming IT issues. As a partner with Google since 2008, Craig was one of the original Glass Explorers, Google’s original beta test group. In early 2013, Craig advanced to an elite small team for this innovative technology. Since then, under his leadership and Basecamp’s agricultural focus, Craig’s vision for Glass led his team to develop intelliSCOUT®, the world’s first wearable application offering farmers a truly hands-free solution, enabling agricultural problem-solving by collecting actionable insights from the field in a fraction of the time. intelliSCOUT® technology has been demonstrated, in conjunction with the Basecamp Networks’ offering, to dignitaries throughout the world, including France, where Craig was personally requested to present this technology to President Francois Hollande. In October 2016 Craig and Basecamp won the Atlanta Telecom Partnership (ATP) Technology Service Provider of The Year Award (in addition to his achievements in agricultural technological advancements).</p> <p>Prior to founding Basecamp Networks, Craig was recruited by Verizon Wireless in 2001 where he oversaw U.S. Southeast Operations in the network engineering division and was later tasked with deploying LTE in the Southeast United States. Craig’s advanced innovative solutions are currently in use across Verizon’s entire company footprint today. During this time Craig also received a bachelor’s degree from Muhlenberg College in Business Administration, and a Computer Science degree from AIU.</p> <p>In addition to his contributions in the public sector, Craig served honorably in the United States Marine Corps as an intelligence communications operator with the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) 2nd Force Recon Battalion. He was later assigned as a detached “special operator” under the Department of the Navy, to Naval Special Warfare Unit S.E.A.L. Teams as a “joint operator” before being honorably discharged in 2001 for medical reasons. During his six years of service, Craig was highly decorated with various commendations and medals for his service and valor.</p> <p>Craig is very active in mission work with his church that includes providing internet services in rural and remote locations globally. Basecamp Networks is headquartered in Alpharetta, GA where Craig resides with his wife and children.</p> <h5 id=\"cool-things-of-the-week\">Cool things of the week</h5> <ul> <li>Google Cloud Platform launches Northern Virginia region <a href=\"https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/05/Google-Cloud-Platform-launches-Northern-Virginia-region.html\"> announcement</a>.</li> <li>Compute Engine machine types with up to 64 vCPUs now ready for your production workloads <a href= \"https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/05/Compute-Engine-machine-types-with-up-to-64-vCPUs-now-ready-for-your-production-workloads.html\"> announcement</a>. <ul> <li>Listen to <a href= \"https://gcppodcast.com/post/episode-41-descartes-labs-with-tim-kelton/\"> Episode #41 Descartes Labs with Tim Kelton</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Terraforming the Google Cloud <a href= \"http://alexander.holbreich.org/terraform-google-cloud/\">alexander.holbreich.org</a>.</li> </ul> <h5 id=\"interview\">Interview</h5> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://basecampnetworks.com/\">Basecamp Networks</a></li> <li>OpenCV: Open Computer Vision <a href= \"http://opencv.org/\">opencv.org</a></li> <li>Tensorflow: An open-source software library for Machine Intelligence <a href= \"https://www.tensorflow.org/\">tensorflow.org</a></li> <li>Lagom: The Opinionated Microservices Framework for moving away from the Monolith <a href= \"https://www.lagomframework.com/\">lagomframework.com</a></li> <li>intelliSCOUT: a product of Basecamp Networks <a href= \"http://www.intelliscout.io/\">intelliscout.io</a></li> </ul> <div style=\"text-align: center\"><a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/\"><img src= \"./images/post/basecampnetworks.png\" style=\"margin: auto;\" width= \"50%\" /></a></div> <h5 id=\"question-of-the-week\">Question of the week</h5> <p>How can I learn machine learning for free?</p> <p>Follow this courses:</p> <ul> <li>Machine Learning by Stanford University <a href= \"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning\">coursera</a></li> <li>Deep Learning by Google <a href= \"https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730\">Udacity</a></li> <li>CS 20SI: Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research <a href= \"http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html\">Stanford</a></li> </ul> <p>And more:</p> <ul> <li>Google Machine Learning Engine and episode <a href= \"https://gcppodcast.com/post/episode-71-cloud-ml-with-yufeng-guo/\">gcppodcast #71</a></li> <li>Tensorflow with Eli Bixby <a href= \"https://gcppodcast.com/post/episode-31-tensorflow-with-eli-bixby/\"> gcppodcast #31</a></li> <li>Announcing general availability of GPUs for Cloud Machine Learning Engine <a href= \"https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/05/announcing-general-availability-of-gpus-for-cloud-machine-learning-engine\"> announcement</a></li> </ul> <h5 id=\"where-can-you-find-us-next\">Where can you find us next?</h5> <p>Francesc presented at Gopherfest and <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giUatBmmb_Y\">the video</a> is already out there!
