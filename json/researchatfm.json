を超えるがこれはかなり「外れ値」なようで、2番目に重い種より2倍ほども重い (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/660084\">Fernández et al., 2011</a>). <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13898\">AVONET</a>（大元はDunning）によるとこの2番目に重い種というのは <a

<a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A2%A8%E5%88%87%E7%BE%BD\">ウィキペディア</a>。東先生の本にはそう書いてたかもしれないが、「初列が推力で次列が揚力」なんていう明確な区別があるというのは眉唾、というかそもそも推力というのは揚力を分解して出てくる成分なので…（もちろん東先生はそのことはわかっているが）。</li>\n

href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.0170\">Yanoviak et al., 2010</a> によると主に後脚で制御してるようです（色々な脚を remove しての比較落下試験をしている）。また、落下角度が水平から45度を境界とする（それより浅いのを gliding, 深いのを parachuting）のは確かに文献にあるようです（初出？は <a href=\"https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1086/281666\">Oliver, 1951</a> らしいが読めなかった）が、そういうことよりも飛行が制御されてるかどうかで分けろや、とかなんか色々あるようです。詳しくは <a

細胞農業は、バイオテクノロジー、組織工学、分子生物学、合成生物学を組み合わせた細胞培養による農産物の生産に焦点を当てており、従来の農業からでなければ得られなかったタンパク質、脂肪、組織を生産する新しい方法を創造し、設計することを目的としている。 業界のほとんどは、養殖家畜を飼育・屠殺するのではなく、細胞培養で生産された肉、牛乳、卵などの動物製品に焦点を当てている。 最もよく知られている細胞農業の概念は、培養肉である。Meat, Dairy(乳製品), Eggs, Gelatin, Coffee, Horseshoe Crab Blood\t(カブトガニ, 成分を含む青い血液は、毒素エンドトキシンの検査薬として使われている), Fish, Fragrances(フレグランス), Silk, Leather, Pet Foodが含まれる。</li>\n
